DDiabetes Care ClinicsCommunity Impact - COVID-19 Vaccine ClinicsSince 2007, Pacific's Medicare Part D Outreach Clinics have assisted 11,108 beneficiaries with their Medicare Part D drug plan, helping beneficiaries save an estimated total of $11.27 million.Doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) students work with each beneficiary to evaluate all Part D prescription drug plan offerings to identify the one that will help minimize out-of-pocket prescription drug costs.We intend to serve as an objective, unbiased resource that beneficiaries can rely upon in getting accurate information about Medicare Part D plan offerings.The need for these events is ongoing, as Medicare Part D plan offerings change each year, as do the formulary and cost-sharing structure of each plan.Students also provide Medication Therapy Management, a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's medications to ensure they are safe and effective to take together.If needed (and with permission from the patient), we will contact the beneficiary's physician and/or pharmacist and share with them our findings and make specific recommendations.Medicare Open Enrollment:October 15 \u2013 December 7During this window of time, beneficiaries can change their Medicare Part D drug plan.If you need help with selecting a Part D plan or want to ensure your current plan is the \u2018best\u2019 one for you, please attend one of our virtual community outreach events.Medicare Part D Outreach Clinics Patient ImpactPlay VideoMake an appointmentAppointments are highly recommended for Part D and medication review services.Appointments

    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help me select the Medicare Part D plan that is right for me?",

    {
      "question": "What is Medication Therapy Management (MTM)?We will review all of your medications to make sure that they are safe to take together and answer any questions that you may have.",
      "answer": "If we have concerns, we can directly contact your prescriber and/or pharmacist to share our recommendations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I attend my Part D and/or medication review intervention with my spouse or family member so we can both be assisted together?",
      "answer": "Absolutely!When you make an appointment please indicate that both of you will need an intervention and on the day of the event the two of you will be placed into the same intervention.While doing this will increase the length of the intervention, we are happy to accommodate this type of request."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I sign up for my appointment?",
      "answer": "It is best to schedule an appointment as soon as possible.This will ensure that you are able to find a day and time that works best for you.We anticipate that we will have a full house at most events this year."
    },
    {

      "answer": "Yes, if you attend our IN-PERSON events, but wait times may vary.For all VIRTUAL events, scheduling an appointment is REQUIRED, not recommended.This is due to the intricacies of the telehealth interventions that we will be performing this year.We hope you understand."

    },
    {
      "question": "Should I be concerned with my personal information being leaked by using telehealth services?",
      "answer": "We have been working closely with our Information Technology department and local experts on ways to ensure privacy of our interventions and to protect these sessions.We have several safeguards in place to ensure that this is the case.Your privacy is our number one concern and we will do our best to never compromise your trust."

      "question": "What is refinancing?",
      "answer": "Refinancing is the process of obtaining a new loan to pay off an existing one, often with the goal of securing a lower interest rate or reducing monthly payments.For international students, refinancing can be an opportunity to release a cosigner and consolidate multiple loans into one, making it easier to keep track of payments and manage your finances.Building a solid credit score in the U.S.may enable you to qualify for better rates on refinanced loans, thus reducing the amount you pay in interest every month.Keep in mind that not all lenders provide student loan refinancing for international students, so it\u2019s essential to research and understand your options.How refinancing worksRefinancing student loans involves a new lender paying off your existing loan(s) with a new loan.Your new loan will have different terms and a potentially more favorable interest rate.When you\u2019re thinking about refinancing your student loans, it\u2019s crucial to carefully examine the new interest rate, repayment terms and any fees the new lender might charge.By doing so, you can ensure refinancing is the best move for your financial future.International student loan refinancing challengesRefinancing international student loans comes with a unique set of challenges.Many lenders may not offer refinancing options for international students or may have stringent requirements making it difficult for them to qualify.Limited credit historyA significant challenge faced by international students when attempting to refinance their student loans is having a limited or nonexistent U.S.credit history.Most lenders rely on credit histories and scores to make underwriting decisions, which can make it difficult for international students to get approved for refinancing.Nonetheless, if you start building a U.S.credit history now, you can enhance your chances of refinancing in the future and qualify for superior loan terms.Most U.S.lenders report payment history to credit bureaus, and you can develop a credit history by:Opening a secured or unsecured credit card account.Financing a larger purchase, such as a car or an appliance.Making timely payments.Temporary visa statusTemporary visa status can also pose a challenge for international students when refinancing their student loans.Not all lenders have the ability to service and collect on loans internationally, and they may not be able to approve noncitizens on temporary visas, making it more difficult to find refinancing options.Eligibility requirements for refinancing student loansTo qualify for student loan refinancing, you typically need to meet certain eligibility requirements, such as:Having a history of making debt payments on time.Having a steady income.Having a low debt-to-income ratio.Having good or excellent credit.Understanding these requirements in depth and evaluating your financial status are crucial to determine if refinancing is a viable option for you.Stable employment and incomeHaving stable employment and income is a key factor when it comes to student loan refinancing.Lenders want to ensure you have the means to repay the loan, so they require proof of steady income and employment.By providing pay stubs, tax returns and bank statements, you can demonstrate your financial stability and increase your chances of approval for refinancing.Building a strong credit history in the U.S.can also improve your chances of qualifying for better refinancing terms and interest rates.Debt-to-income ratioAnother important factor in determining your eligibility for refinancing is your debt-to-income ratio.This ratio compares your monthly debt payments to your gross monthly income and is calculated by dividing your total monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income.A debt-to-income ratio of less than 43% is considered optimal for refinancing, as it indicates you have a manageable debt load and are more likely to be approved for refinancing.Good credit scoreA good credit score is essential for qualifying for better loan terms and interest rates when refinancing your student loans.Most lenders require a minimum credit score of 690 to refinance a student loan.Steps to refinance your international student loanRefinancing your international student loan involves following a series of steps to ensure a successful application and approval process.These steps include:Assessing your financial situation.Comparing lenders and offers.Preparing necessary documentation.Submitting your application.Monitoring progress.Assess your financial situationBefore embarking on the refinancing process, it is vital to evaluate your financial status to decide if refinancing aligns with your needs.This involves taking a close look at your current income, debt-to-income ratio and credit score to get a comprehensive overview of your financial health.By evaluating your current financial picture, you can determine if you qualify for a lower interest rate or lower monthly payments and understand the potential savings and benefits of refinancing.Compare lenders and offersAfter evaluating your financial status, the next step involves comparing different lenders and their offers to identify the most optimal refinancing option.This involves researching and evaluating the interest rates, repayment terms and other features of different lenders.By comparing these factors, you can make an informed decision about which lender and refinancing option is most suitable for your financial situation and goals.Prepare necessary documentationOnce you\u2019ve selected the most suitable lender and refinancing option, the next move is to compile the requisite documentation for your application.This may include:Recent pay stubs or proof of employment.Tax documents.Valid identification documents.Loan statements.Having all of this documentation readily available will make the application process smoother and increase your chances of approval.Submit your application and monitor progressThe final step in the refinancing journey involves:Submitting your application.Tracking its progress.Proactively communicating with the lender.Providing any additional information or documentation they may require.Staying on top of your application and maintaining open communication with the lender will help ensure a successful refinancing process and potentially save you time and money in the long run.Top lenders for international student loan refinancingSeveral leading student loan refinance lenders offer options to

Bank do not qualify for the formal forbearance policy \u2013 a critical point to remember.Building your credit history in the U.S.Establishing a strong U.S.credit history is crucial for international students who want to improve their chances of approval for refinancing.Building credit in the U.S.involves:Using secured credit cards.Making timely bill payments.Monitoring your credit report to ensure your credit history accurately reflects your financial behavior.Adopting these measures can elevate your credit score and enhance your financial position, simplifying the process of qualifying for refinancing and potentially enabling access to better loan terms.Secured credit cardsOne way for international students to establish a credit history in the U.S.is by using secured credit cards.Secured credit cards require a cash security deposit, which acts as collateral and reduces the risk for the lender.By using these cards responsibly and making on-time payments, international students can demonstrate their creditworthiness and build a positive credit history in the U.S.This, in turn, can help them qualify in the future for other types of credit, such as student loan refinancing.Timely bill paymentsPaying bills on time is another essential component in building a strong credit history and improving credit scores.Consistently making timely bill payments demonstrates to lenders that you are responsible with your finances, which can help you build a strong credit history.You can ensure timely bill payments by setting up automatic payments, setting reminders and budgeting for bills, which will help you stay on top of your finances and avoid late fees.Monitoring your credit reportRegularly monitoring your credit report is crucial in building and maintaining a strong credit history.By keeping an eye on your credit report, you can spot errors, identify areas for improvement and track your progress in building credit.If you find any errors in your credit report, you should dispute them with the appropriate credit bureaus to ensure your credit history accurately reflects your financial behavior.Additional options for international borrowersAlternative financing solutions are available for international borrowers who might not meet the qualifications for conventional refinancing options.Exploring these additional options can help you find the most suitable solution for your unique needs and financial circumstances.Personal loansPersonal loans can be a viable option for international borrowers looking to pay off their private student loans with a more favorable interest rate.These loans are typically provided by banks, credit unions or online lenders and can be used for various purposes, including paying off student loans.To qualify for a personal loan, you typically need a reliable source of income, a healthy debt-to-income ratio and good credit, but the exact requirements may be different from a dedicated refinancing product.By comparing personal loan offers and carefully evaluating interest rates and repayment terms, you can determine if a personal loan is a suitable alternative to refinancing your student loans.Family or friend loansBorrowing from family or friends may be an option if you are unable to qualify for traditional refinancing solutions.While this option can provide you with the funds you need, it\u2019s essential to establish clear written terms and repayment plans to avoid potential financial and relationship complications.By setting a repayment plan, interest rate and any other relevant terms upfront, you can ensure a successful family or friend loan that benefits and protects both you and the lender.SummaryRefinancing your international student loans can be a powerful tool in managing your student loan debt and potentially reducing the amount of interest you pay by thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.By understanding the benefits, challenges and steps involved in the refinancing process, and considering top lenders like MPOWER Financing, SoFi and Citizens Bank, you can take control of your financial future.As you navigate the world of refinancing, remember to explore all available options, including building a U.S.credit history, enlisting a co-signer and considering alternative financing solutions, to find the best refinancing solution for your unique needs."

      "answer": "A merit scholarship is a financial award given to college students based on their academic achievements or other talents in a specific field.Unlike need-based financial aid, merit-based scholarships are awarded based on academic achievement, extracurricular activities and other criteria, such as leadership skills or community involvement.Merit scholarships are an excellent way to fund your college education.These merit awards can help relieve some of the financial burdens that often accompany a college education, allowing students to focus on their academic success and personal growth.Merit scholarships come in many forms, from generous scholarships offered by colleges and universities to partial awards provided by private organizations and foundations.To help find the right one for you, let\u2019s dive deeper into the criteria and types of merit scholarships available.Criteria for Merit ScholarshipsThe criteria for merit scholarships can vary and generally revolves around a few key factors.Your grade point average (GPA) is often a significant consideration with the minimum requirement usually starting at 3.0, although this may vary.In addition to your GPA, standardized test scores, such as SAT or ACT results, are commonly considered as well.Beyond academic achievements, merit scholarships also consider your extracurricular activities and demonstrated leadership skills.For example, serving as an officer or team captain in student organizations, sports, honor societies, community groups or jobs can showcase your leadership abilities and increase your chances of securing a merit scholarship.So, make sure you give equal weight to both your academic performance and extracurricular involvement when applying for merit scholarships.Types of Merit ScholarshipsThere are several types of merit scholarships available to talented students with a wide range of interests and achievements.Merit scholarships may be offered by colleges and universities themselves, private corporations or foundations, and local or community-based organizations.TheNational Merit Scholarship Programis an esteemed program which recognizes the best high school students in the country.Those who qualify are rewarded with scholarships based on their exceptional PSAT and SAT scores.Applicants must satisfy certain criteria to be eligible.They must be U.S.citizens or permanent residents in high school and have taken the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT) by their junior year.With various tiers and awards available, the National Merit Scholarship Program is just one example of the many merit scholarships that can help support your college education.How to Find the Best Merit ScholarshipsA little research and persistence will uncover a treasure trove of scholarship opportunities.Always start with your school\u2019s financial aid office.It\u2019s a great resource.Next, search online using a search platform such asIEFA.orgThe site lists thousands of scholarships for international students.As you research, you\u2019ll be able to create a list of potential merit awards tailored to your unique qualities and achievements.Also, apply for partial scholarships.Partial scholarships will only cover a portion of your costs, but there are advantages that make the application effort worthwhile.Partial scholarships outnumber full scholarships.There\u2019s less competition for partial scholarships, so you have a better chance of winning one, and there\u2019s no limit to how many you can apply for.Having multiple partial scholarships can quickly add up.College and University ScholarshipsStart by exploring your college or university\u2019s website.Many institutions offer merit scholarships to incoming freshmen, current students and even graduate students.Some scholarships may be specific to a certain major, while others may cater to students with outstanding achievements in various fields.Be sure to explore pages for specific majors, offices of community or civic engagement, athletics and the arts for more specific awards.Reach out to your assigned admissions counselor.Once they get to know you better, they can direct you to opportunities specific to your interests and skills.Private Organizations and FoundationsPrivate organizations and foundations also offer merit scholarships with varying eligibility requirements.For example, theTerry Crews \u201cCreative Courage\u201d Scholarshipis a $20,000 scholarship designed to support talented artists, while theBTL Athletes Scholarshipis a $75,000 merit scholarship available to high school upperclassmen and undergraduate student-athletes from low-income backgrounds.Search online and check the eligibility criteria of each scholarship before applying.Pay close attention to the application process, which may require a separate application, essays, recommendation letters and other evidence of exemplary performance.Local and Community-based ScholarshipsLocal and community-based scholarships can be a hidden gem in your scholarship search.These scholarships may have a lower applicant pool due to their more restrictive eligibility requirements, increasing your chances of success.For example, thePeter T.Buecher Memorial Scholarshipis a $1,000 scholarship open to high school seniors or undergraduate students in Minnesota who play sports.To find local and community-based scholarships, consult with your high school guidance counselors, college financial aid offices and community foundations.They can provide valuable information about scholarships that cater to your interests and achievements, giving you additional opportunities to fund your college education.How

the application, including any required essays, interviews, or additional materials.When searching for local scholarships, make sure you consider those tailored to your individual qualities, such as your interests, achievements, or background.By focusing on scholarships that align with your unique strengths, you\u2019ll maximize your chances of being awarded the financial aid you need to pursue your college education.Crafting a Compelling EssayA compelling essay can be the key to standing out in a competitive pool of applicants.Start the writing process early, allowing yourself ample time to reflect on your experiences, research the scholarship provider\u2019s mission and purpose and seek feedback from others.Reading examples ofsuccessful scholarship essayscan help you craft a personal and captivating essay.In your essay, focus on any skills, talents, or unique experiences that differentiate you from other applicants, such as your personal experiences, achievements, or aspirations.By crafting an essay that showcases your unique qualities and aligns with the provider\u2019s goals, you\u2019ll increase your chances of securing the merit scholarship you desire.Gathering Strong Letters of RecommendationLetters of recommendation are a crucial component of most merit scholarship applications, as they attest to your capabilities and potential.Consider asking individuals who know you and your talents, such as teachers, coaches, high school counselors, extracurricular advisors, job supervisors or members of church or community organizations.It\u2019s essential to submit your recommendation and nomination requests at least one month prior to application deadlines, and early submission is encouraged.By allowing ample time for your recommenders to craft thoughtful and compelling letters, you\u2019ll enhance your chances of securing the merit scholarship you seek.Maintaining and Renewing Merit ScholarshipsOnce you\u2019ve been awarded a merit scholarship, it\u2019s important to understand the requirements and strategies for maintaining and renewing your scholarship.By keeping track of renewal requirements and implementing strategies for

and the completion of at least 12 credit hours per semester.It\u2019s crucial to stay informed about the renewal requirements of your specific scholarship to ensure you remain eligible for financial aid.By diligently maintaining your academic performance and adhering to the established criteria, you\u2019ll be well-positioned to renew your merit scholarship and continue benefiting from its financial support.Strategies for Continued SuccessTo maintain success with merit scholarships, it\u2019s essential to adhere to deadlines, maintain a high GPA and consider applying for additional

education.Also, don\u2019t forget to keep up with any continuing requirements from your school\u2019s financial aid office and participate in extracurricular activities that showcase your commitment and leadership abilities.By staying proactive and consistently striving for excellence, you\u2019ll be well-equipped to maintain and renew your merit scholarships throughout your college journey.Navigating the Merit Scholarship TimelineConsider the merit scholarship timeline when applying for and maintaining scholarships.Research application deadlines, notification timelines and acceptance timelines, so you\u2019re well prepared to submit competitive applications and manage your financial aid effectively.Application DeadlinesTimeliness is paramount when applying for merit scholarships.Application deadlines vary with each scholarship, so it\u2019s essential to check the scholarship\u2019s website for their deadlines.For example, theGE Foundation Engineering Scholarship Program for Freshmenhas a deadline of early May, while theRonald McDonald House Charities Scholarshipusually requires applications to be submitted by the end of January.To ensure you submit your applications on time, start the application process at least four months prior to the earliest deadlines.This will give you ample time to collect the necessary materials, write compelling essays and gather strong letters of recommendation.Notification and Acceptance TimelinesThe notification and acceptance timelines for merit scholarships varies depending on the particular scholarship and the institution offering it.Generally, you can expect to hear back about your application one to three months following the submission deadline.By being aware of these timelines, you can plan accordingly

1995Teaching InterestsWhether I am working with advanced English majors in an upper-division course or first-year students in the CORE seminars, my underlying goal is to facilitate students' growing awareness of themselves as intellectuals\u2014people who use their minds to find connections, to read situations critically and historically, and to think about the relationship between literature and important questions that arise in the current moment.To keep students engaged, I tend to deliver brief, informative lectures related to our readings and explorations of literature, film, or other texts.I often ask students to offer brief presentations that pose observations, ask questions, or contribute knowledge and further context to our reading.I encourage student participation on multiple levels.For example, students formulate final projects and demonstrate their abilities to design, organize, and carry out assignments that began as intellectual curiosities.On numerous occasions, students have pursued these curiosities further by undertaking independent research projects.In all my courses, careful and close reading is a principal component of our work together.Sometimes the most fruitful class sessions have occurred when we have abandoned the task of \"covering the material\" and, instead, have yielded to the force of the words on the page, slowly reading and rereading, meditating on a single phrase or word\u2014tracing its rich etymological and philological meanings.These have been moments of pedagogical and intellectual grace.As Edward Said reminds us in one of his final books, Humanism and Democratic Criticism (2004), philology was practiced by some of the most radical and intellectually audacious minds of the last 150 years.It is this radical audacity that I hope to inspire in students.Research FocusEarly and 19th century American Literature, World Literature, Criticism and Theory, Law and Literature, U.S.Empire, Liberalism and Neoliberalism.I have essayed on a range of topics addressing transnational American studies; slavery, sentiment, and empire; the enforcement of fugitive slave law; as well as the role of humanistic literary criticism in the of wake of neoliberal economic practices.My work has appeared in the journalsAmerican Literature, Criticism, Telos and Review of International American Studies (RIAS), among others.I am currently completingFugitive Inventions: American Literature, Slavery, and the Force of Law, a book examining the concomitances between 19th-century U.S.literature and the tactics of fugitive slaves within the context of international law and extra-territorial reach of U.S.power in the wake of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act.My next project, tentatively titledIndebted Life: Race, Economy, and Law, examines how

a good fit for you.The path toward a career in dentistry will require extensive dedication which you can deliver if you feel comfortable with your choice.College courses are best taken in college after the high school experience has been completed.High school students may be interested in anticipating some college education, however, in order to facilitate their adjustment to college or to save money by satisfying college course requirements.Advanced courses taken while in high school can sometimes interfere negatively with the college curriculum.The items below categorize courses by the type of interaction that they have with the curriculum of the Pre-Dental Advantage Program.Green light classes.AP, IB or college courses taken in high school (early college) may be used to satisfy requirements of the general education portion (except science) of the Pre-Dental Advantage Program, as long as they can be transferred as equivalent to courses at Pacific that satisfy such requirements.This equivalence can be verified at theROAR webpage.Courses in chemistry and biology may be a good preparation for college when they do not articulate with a Pacific course or when they articulate with Pacific courses that have code numbers lower than BIOL 51 for biology (ex: BIOL 41) or lower than CHEM 25 for chemistry (ex: CHEM23).Yellow light classes.AP, IB or early college classes are acceptable for physics courses that articulate with PHYS 23, 25, 53 or 55 but it is recommended that physics be taken instead at Pacific.Red light classes.AP, IB or early college classes cannot be used to reduce the number of chemistry and biology courses taken while in the Pre-Dental Advantage Program.If you complete a core biology or chemistry course before enrolling at Pacific, you will be required to take a more advanced course in those subjects at Pacific.If you have already taken or want to take these courses, you should inform your undergraduate admission counselor at Pacific and request the transfer of your courses to Pacific.International Dental StudiesIDS Program: How and When to ApplyDugoni Academic ProgramsDDSDDS Admissions RequirementsDDS Program: How and

MoreStockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Fundamental to performing those roles effectively is keeping students engaged.I attempt to do so by following a basic guideline: keep things interesting.And that means keeping things interesting for a range of students with varying skills, learning styles, and backgrounds.I therefore incorporate in my classes a variety of strategies and formats in an effort to reach all of my students, allowing them to make the most of their abilities; I choose readings that are not too dry or technical; I incorporate images and videos into lectures, both so students can better recall course content and so they can place themselves in the shoes of political actors to better understand their decisions; I use humor and other tactics during class to draw students away from other options such as checking social media or getting in a short nap; I tell personal anecdotes during lectures to illustrate complex theories and include real world case studies to bring difficult concepts to life; I invite students try to answer the questions other students, or I, ask; and I have students do small group work in class to grapple with the material.A major goal for each course is for students to leave with a depth of knowledge and skills related to course content.However, my main aim is for students to walk out of my classroom and into the world with the ability to apply what they have learned about political science or intercultural studies in their day to day lives because, in the end, most of their interactions in life will be both political and intercultural.Research FocusMy research analyzes the politics of economic globalization and the effects of political institutions on the choices of domestic actors, such as politicians, voters, and businesspeople in developing states.I am particularly interested in the interplay of the forces of economic globalization and the political institutions that comprise regime type in Asia.Two examples are my papers \"Playing Risk: Chinese Foreign Direct Investment in Cambodia\" (2014) inContemporary Southeast Asiaand\"Risky Business: The Political Economy of Chinese Investment in Kazakhstan\" (2014) in theJournal of Eurasian Studies.In these I analyze how China uses aid and loans to influence foreign governments in order to protect Chinese investments in developing states with high political risk and corruption.I have also published papers on the effects of changes to political institutions on election outcomes in Taiwan, \"Electoral Rules and the Democratic Progressive Party's Performance in the 2004 and 2008 Legislative Elections in Taiwan\" (2012) in theJournal of Asian and African Studiesand on the impact of regime type on the ability of developing states to borrow money,\"Transparent Motives: The Democratic Advantage in International Credit Markets\" (2017)Journal of International Relations and Development, with my SIS colleague Yong Kim.My book,Dividing ASEAN and Conquering the South China Sea: China's Financial Power Projection(2018,https://www.hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1700.php) investigates China's efforts to thwart the ability of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to act collectively in negotiating with the more powerful Chinese over rival territorial claims in the South China Sea.I show how China can do so by using its foreign aid, loans and investment to influence just one ASEAN member to support China's preference for bilateral negotiations with rival claimants rather than multilateral negotiations with a united ASEAN.I conclude that regime type, specifically more authoritarian political institutions, provide avenues for Chinese influence over governments in developing states, but democratic institutions mitigate that influence, thereby constraining China's global power projection.My current projects include a journal article and a co-edited book on the politics of China's Belt and Road Initiative.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.university choices with small collegecaringExplore Academic OpportunitiesNext \u2014Learning EnvironmentLearning EnvironmentA New England campus in the heart

      "answer": "My connection to Stockton community.Being born and raised in Stockton, I wanted to be able to continue to give back and support my local community while in college.Also, the reputation of the Eberhardt School of Business and their accounting program, specifically the Master of Accounting (MAcc) program really appealed to me when I realized I could receive my master\u2019s degree in five years or less.Higher education is important in my family, and I am proud to be a third-generation Pacific Tiger."
    },
    {
      "question": "As an accounting major, what has your Pacific experience been like?",
      "answer": "The accounting courses I have taken have laid the foundation for my internships, as well as my future professional career.These courses gave me the basic knowledge and information.The Dean\u2019s Seminar in my freshman year and the Career Seminar taught by director of the ESB Career Center Margaret Roberts during my junior year, really encouraged me to put together my resume, participate in mock internships and to network with professionals in the accounting industry.My hands-on experience came through the internships."
    },
    {
      "question": "You mentioned internships, could you tell us more about it?",
      "answer": "In the summer of 2020, I was an intern at Farmers & Merchants Bank of Central California.I gained some great hands-on experience because I worked there during the Paycheck Protection Program which offered assistance to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.After my internship, I was able to stay on as a part-time employee in the bank\u2019s payroll department.Then in January 2022, I started a tax internship with Moss Adams in Stockton.I learned so much during this internship.I got first-hand experience of what it\u2019s like for accountants during tax season."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Pacific\u2019s MAcc program?",
      "answer": "Pacific\u2019s MAcc Program is the Master of Accounting Program at the Eberhardt School of Business.It is a blended undergrad/graduate program that allows students the opportunity to fulfill the 150-unit requirement for the certified public accountant (CPA) exam.Many students can complete this program in four-and-a-half to five years.Not only does it set you up for success when taking the CPA exam, it also gives you the foundation to enter the professional workplace."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the benefits of this program?",
      "answer": "It is two extra semesters, in addition to your undergraduate years.MAcc is built so there is an easy transition from the undergraduate accounting program into the graduate program.If someone were to do their master\u2019s degree at another school, they would have to take the GMAT, submit an application with letters of recommendation, and then it would be a minimum of two years of graduate courses.A huge benefit of MAcc is that you are with the same group of classmates all the way through graduation.This is extremely helpful when working on group projects or studying for exams."
    },
    {
      "question": "How would you describe your Pacific experience?",
      "answer": "I have really enjoyed my time at Pacific.It has been rewarding, challenging and adaptable.During spring break 2020, we had to make the transition to online learning due to COVID-19 pandemic and both students and faculty were so flexible and adaptable.Before that, I was a member of the Pacific Women Tennis Team for three years.Athletics allowed me to see another side of campus that most students do not get to be a part of.Being a student athlete really set me up for success by sharpening my skills in teamwork and determination."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can you say about your Pacific professors?",
      "answer": "One of Pacific\u2019s best assets is the professors.They really care about you not only as a student, but as a young professional entering the workforce.The small class sizes allow the professor for more one-on-one help in class or during office hours, and most of them are easy to get a hold of.My favorite thing about the Eberhardt School professors is that they come from very different backgrounds and are eager to share their diverse experiences.I especially enjoyed stories we got to hear from professors Thomas Brierton and Robert Eger."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is next for you?",
      "answer": "I plan to continue working through my accounting program, complete my current three-month internship with the accounting firm, Moss Adams, and return to F&M Bank where I will work in the controller\u2019s department.Both my educational and work experience will set me up for great success as I near graduation in 2023 and begin to study for the CPA exam.In the long-term, I hope to

lawyers and a 1988 graduate of the McGeorge School of Law, and his law partner and wife, renowned legal negotiator Tracy A.Eglet, are giving University of the Pacific\u2019s law school one of the largest gifts in the history of U.S.legal education, the school announced today.The gift, which will be paid out over time, includes $5 million in support of the school\u2019s advocacy center and another $20 million for scholarships dedicated to first-generation students and students of color.The gift is among the top 15 given to a U.S.law school, the third largest to a California law school and the second largest in the 170-year history of California\u2019s first university.\u201cMy wife and I both strongly believe that it is important to give back when you can,\u201d Eglet said.\u201cWe are excited that we have the ability to help students who would not otherwise be able to afford law school.We both relied upon assistance throughout law school.\u201dMcGeorge's award-winning advocacy

costs for every qualified team interested in competing as a member of one of McGeorge\u2019smock trial,moot court, negotiations or other competition teams.\u201cI am so proud of the nationally ranked mock trial program at McGeorge,\u201d Eglet said.\u201cI have seen the students in action as they prepared for upcoming competitions, and I was really impressed.Trial law is my passion, and I want to do something that will enhance McGeorge's mock trial program.\u201dThe law school\u2019s highly ranked competitions programs provide opportunities for students to improve their trial and appellate advocacy skills and refine their talents in client counseling, negotiations, and arbitration.In the past three years alone, a McGeorge student won the national Top Gun competition for the 16 top student trial lawyers; McGeorge tied for seventh in the country in the American Bar Association Competitions Championship; McGeorge\u2019s negotiations team won the national and international ABA

McGeorge students for generations to come,\u201d Callahan said.\u201cRobert and Tracy are amazing role models for all of us as they show the power philanthropy has to change the trajectory of the lives of students who are dedicating themselves to careers in the law.\u201dThe president applaudedDean Michael Hunter Schwartz, who worked closely with the Eglets to design the historic gift.He called the dean, who was named three times to National Jurist Magazine\u2019s list of Most Influential People in Legal Education, a \u201ctruly visionary leader.\u201d\u201cDean Schwartz has dramatically transformed the McGeorge School in just four years at the helm,\u201d Callahan said, pointing to unprecedented successes that include the law school\u2019s highest California bar exam pass rate in 25 years, four consecutive years of improving credentials for incoming students and the best job placement rate in the school\u2019s history.\u201cHe is a remarkable leader.\u201dSchwartz, who attributed McGeorge\u2019s recent success to the school\u2019s faculty and staff, called the Eglets \u201cinspiring.\u201d\u201cI love listening to them talk about their cases.They have so much heart for righting societal wrongs, for curbing abusive practices, and for helping others,\u201d Schwartz said.\u201cThe reason they have been successful and are able to make this extraordinary gift is because they relentlessly pursue justice.\u201dSchwartz put the gift into context.\u201cThe new need-based scholarships will help us address a systemic barrier to diversifying the law school and the profession, and the advocacy center fund will help cement the institution as a leader in trial advocacy, moot court, and legal education,\u201d Schwartz said.The Eglet gift is the largest donation in the law school\u2019s 97-year history.McGeorge will receive an additional $5 million in matching funds from Pacific\u2019s Powell

McGeorge School of Law, is a long-term, collaborative effort with local elementary, middle and high schools, community colleges and colleges.The legal employers are committed to addressing the need for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the legal profession and building more inclusive pathways to law school.The Collective is a group of 37 of the largest legal employers in Sacramento, with a mix of local, national, and international law firms; state agencies; and public defender and district attorney offices.Members of the Sacramento Legal Employers Diversity Collective are engaging in a four-pronged approach to remedying the lack of diversity across the continuum of legal employment.The Collective prongs are:Pathways Program \u2014There cannot be a more diverse legal workforce if\u00a0people from historically underrepresented communities do not think they can pursue a career in the legal profession.McGeorge\u2019s Pathways Program brings middle and high school students to McGeorge\u2019s campus and sends attorneys to middle and high schools to talk about the legal profession careers in law.The Collective is working to expand the number of schools and students that this program reaches.Mentoring \u2014Many legal employers have mentoring programs for new attorneys within their organizations.The Collective will work with employers and affinity bar groups to help pair diverse attorneys with mentors at a different employer and, ideally, from similar backgrounds.Recruitment and Retention \u2014Attorneys from diverse backgrounds historically have higher attrition rates in legal careers than white attorneys.The Collective is working to break down silos between employers and give them a constructive space to share information on what is and is not working when it comes to recruiting and retaining a diverse legal workforce.Once the Collective has developed best practices, it will conduct trainings and hold events to help employers implement the best practices.DEI Skills Identification \u2014The Collective will survey employers for the diversity, equity, and inclusion skills they want to see in new hires.Using that data, McGeorge will retool its curriculum to ensure students graduate with those skills.DEI Skills Identification Subcommittee MembersAssociate Dean Mary-Beth Moylan; McGeorge School of Law (Lead)Deepi Miller; Greenberg

Resources LawStockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.When Joshua White, \u201921, was applying to law schools, he already knew University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law by reputation; he was aware, for example, that McGeorge\u2019sTrial Advocacy Programis ranked eighth in the nation.During his first on-campus visit, Joshua metCary Bricker, the Co-Director of McGeorge\u2019sEglet Center for Advocacy and Dispute Resolutionand No\u00ebl M.Ferris Professor of Trial Skills.White still recalls what she told him.\u201cWe are going to make you into an amazing attorney!\u201d she said.Bricker observed that at the end of that very first conversation with Joshua, she knew he would be a spectacular trial lawyer who would give voice to indigent clients and make a real difference in the world, all of which are now proving true.White, who had more than a dozen employment offers right out of law school, believes Bricker delivered on her promise.And he was thrilled that, out of a pool of roughly 1,000 applicants, he received one of four job offers to work at the New York County Defender Services in Manhattan, New York, which was his dream job.As a trial attorney, White serves indigent clients in both misdemeanor and felony cases.He represents his clients at all stages of the criminal process, from arraignment to sentencing, and any time a case goes to trial.White is also the lead attorney on a team that considers each client\u2019s holistic needs, which sometimes requires help from the office\u2019s social workers, investigation team, immigration or housing attorneys.White credits his education at McGeorge School of Law for how well-equipped he was to take on these responsibilities.\u201cI felt really prepared when I started my job.I did not feel nervous going to court for the first time,\u201d White said.White was a stand-out on the law school\u2019s award-winningmock trial team, where students act as trial counsel through all stages of litigation, including pretrial motions, opening and closing statements, direct and cross examinations.In fact, as White was interviewing for jobs, many potential employers asked him to deliver a closing argument, cross-examine a witness, or prepare a motion in limine \u2014 all skills that he honed in mock trial.By the time White graduated, he had also represented actual clients through McGeorge\u2019s year-longFederal Defender Clinic.Under the supervision of Assistant Federal DefendersLinda HarterandRachelle Barbour, who co-teach the clinic along with Adjunct ProfessorTimothy Zindel, students are assigned to represent persons charged with misdemeanor crimes occurring under federal jurisdiction such as on military bases and in U.S.parks and the National Forests in the Eastern District of California.\u201cStudents handle all aspects of the cases from initial appearance and client interviews through motions, plea, trial, and sentencing.Students in the clinic have conducted complicated evidentiary hearings as well as jury trials,\u201d Zindel said.\u201cIt is the best possible introduction to working as a public defender because it is not a simulation.Students represent real people with real cases.\u201dThroughout his time at McGeorge School of Law, White had opportunities to form meaningful relationships with mentors who have impacted his career.He recalls regularly attending McGeorge\u2019s various alumni networking events.Further, White\u2019s position as president of theBlack Law Student Association (BLSA)gave him opportunities to reach out to alumni himself.McGeorge\u2019s location in Sacramento also enabled him to meet legislators in the halls of the State Capitol building.One such legislator was former Assemblymember, now Secretary of State, Dr.Shirley Weber.On his desk, White still has the certificate that she gave to him, in recognition for his work with BLSA.White advises future attorneys to not get overwhelmed or discouraged.\u201cIf this is the work that you want to do that you are inspired to do, there is a place for you,\u201d he said.McGeorge School of LawRelated NewsMcGeorge School of Law's moot court program ranked No.14 in

by adding some exposure to the elements of\u00a0technology that are shaping the 21st Century.This minor is open to non-engineering students only.Engineering and technology are integral parts of many careers and fields of study.As \"technology\" has become so prevalent in our lives and careers, more and more companies are demanding that their employees have working knowledge in such areas as design, graphics, communications, hardware and software advances, etc.Consequently, college students majoring in non-technical disciplines would be well advised to consider taking advantage of technology-related courses to bolster their knowledge and awareness in any of these areas.In order to provide a structure and formal recognition towards this end, Pacific offers a Minor in Technology.The Technology Minor provides an introduction to various aspects of engineering and technology which will strengthen a student's employment qualifications.The University offers a number of engineering and technology-related courses which are basic enough in their content that non-engineering students can enjoy enrollment without intimidation.Phrases like \"The Age of Technology\" and \"Information era\" reflect the demand for professionals with more knowledge about engineering and technology.The student who takes advantage of this structured approach to additional studies will likely enjoy much greater job and salary recognition upon college graduation.For more information, contact Dr Gary Martin 209.946.3064 or visit him on campus in the Chambers Technology Center (CTC) 104 with any questions.Minor in Technology RequirementsStudent must not be majoring in engineering.Student must complete a program, approved by the minor advisor, consisting of a minimum of twenty

      "question": "For more information, contact:Michael Doherty Associate Dean, School of Engineering and Computer ScienceHow soon can you transfer?",
      "answer": "Community college students can transfer to the School of Engineering and Computer Science at any point in their academic program.Most state colleges require that community college students complete their entire freshman and sophomore curriculum prior to transferring to the four-year universities.This is not true at Pacific.If you do not have a least 15 units of college credit, then Pacific will also require the SAT or ACT and will heavily consider your high school academic records as well.The stronger your grades and the harder your courses, the sooner you could be admitted to Pacific.English 1AMost colleges have a basic writing course called, \"English 1A\" or something very similar.If your writing skills are very strong, you will not be required to take a course like this at Pacific (you will be given a reading and a writing test to determine whether you have passed Pacific's Fundamental Skills Requirement in reading and writing).But it is a good course anyhow, so you may want to consider taking it at your current college, thereby exempting yourself from any possibility of having to take it once you get to Pacific.Master of Science in Law -

      "question": "OnlineOn-Campus Interviews (OCI) InformationAlumni ResourcesEmployer ResourcesOn-Campus Interviews (OCI) InformationRecruiting at McGeorgeWhat is OCI?",
      "answer": "OCI stands for On-Campus Interviews.Every fall and spring, McGeorge invites legal employers to campus to interview 2D/3E and 3D/4E students for summer and post-graduation jobs.McGeorge's OCI program is a unique hybrid of private and public employers of all sizes.Our OCI employers have a wide variety of GPA and class rank requirements, thereby allowing all of our students the opportunity to participate.Our program consists of the traditional OCI format, where law firms come to the McGeorge campus to interview students who have certain qualifications.It is also comprised of employers from a wide range of legal sectors that do not necessarily have class rank or GPA requirements.These sectors include JAG, government agencies, DA/PD offices, small- and mid-sized general practice law firms, and boutique firms focused on particular practice areas such as intellectual property, land use, and water law.We draw employers from the local Sacramento area, the entire Central Valley, and throughout California and Nevada.Registration for McGeorge\u2019s Virtual Fall On-Campus Interviews 2023 program begins March 29, 2023 on Symplicity.(Interviews will be virtual on the Flo Recruit platform.)Fall OCI 2023 Employer Session 1 \u2014 Interview Dates: Aug.29, 30 & 31Fall OCI 2023 Employer Session 2 \u2014 Interview Dates: Sept."

    {
      "question": "5, 6 & 7How to Participate | StudentsHow to Participate | EmployersWhat is OCI?",
      "answer": "On-Campus Interviews (OCI) is a program that brings legal employer to our campus every fall and spring to interview 2D/3E and 3D/4E students for summer and post-graduate position.Fall interviews take place in August and September, but you'll submit applications well in advance \u2014 beginning in June.Spring interviews take place in February and March, and employers will interview 1D/2E, 2D/3E and 3D/4E students for summer and post-graduate positions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the timing of OCI?",
      "answer": "Fall OCI is comprised of three weekly deadlines which correspond to groups of employers interviewing during the same week.Different employers participate in each week, or \"group\" of OCI.While there are three group deadlines, the vast majority of employers participate in the first week of OCI, so you should not put off bidding on interviews."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are my chances of getting a job through OCI?",
      "answer": "Typically, a small percentage of students receive job offers through OCI.However, this is still one of the best ways to get your resume in the hands of an employer, and we therefore encourage everyone to participate.You could be one of the students who get a job!I heard a rumor that OCI is only for the top of the class."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is that true?",
      "answer": "While some employers specify a class rank requirement, most OCI employers don't.Many employers are focusing less on grades and class rank, and more on practical experience and other factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "The bottom line is that everyone should apply through OCI!Why should I participate in OCI?",
      "answer": ""
    },
    {
      "question": "Why not?!",
      "answer": "This is one of the easiest ways to get your resume and cover letter in the hands of an employer.While we can't guarantee that you will be selected for an interview, we can certainly guarantee that if you don't apply, you won't be selected.OCI is a great opportunity and every student should plan to take advantage of this program.As a side benefit, participating in Fall OCI will force you to get your resume, cover letter, and other application materials polished and ready to go early in the academic year so that you are ready to act on any other job postings that come up throughout the year, whether through MCO or otherwise."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of employers participate in OCI?",
      "answer": "Fall OCI employers are primarily medium-to-large private law firms and government agencies.Spring OCI tends to have a higher percentage of small firms or employers.There may be a handful of public interest positions available through OCI, but typically OCI does not have a large selection of public interest employers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it matter if I upload my application materials first or last?",
      "answer": "In a word, no.Employers do not have access to your recruiting materials until the day following the deadline, and they have no way of knowing when students uploaded their materials.However, we recommend that you submit your OCI materials in advance (and after they've been vetted by a career advisor) to save yourself the stress of putting everything together at the last minute and running the risk of making a mistake.Also, do NOT wait until 11:40 p.m.on the OCI bid date to start uploading \u2014 there are often delays and you may miss the deadline altogether."
    },
    {
      "question": "Good luck!What if I don't get a job through Fall OCI?",
      "answer": "Don't despair.OCI is just one of many ways that law students find jobs.Most jobs are obtained through other techniques, such as networking and responding to McGeorgeCareersOnline (MCO) job postings.Even if you do participate in OCI, we recommend that you plan a concurrent non-OCI job search.Also, don't forget that there is Spring OCI.While a bit smaller than Fall OCI, Spring OCI tends to draw a different selection of employers comes to campus.We recommend that you plan on submitting bids in both Fall and Spring OCI, while continuing to focus effort on your non-OCI job search."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can I do now to prepare for OCI?",
      "answer": "In the upcoming weeks, we will send you more information about preparing for OCI.As a starting point, you will need to update your profile on MCO as this is how you will submit OCI bids.You should also update your resume and cover letter and plan to have them reviewed.You will also need to start thinking about compiling a list of references, polishing a writing sample, and tracking down appropriate transcripts.We recommend that you and make sure you have a solid writing sample and list of references by the end of the summer.It is also very important that you routinely check your email for updates, tips and information relating to OCI.We will be providing you with a lot of useful information so that you are ready to submit your bids before the first deadline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why don't I see very many Fall OCI employers listed?",
      "answer": "When you view the OCI employers on MCO you will only see those employers that are recruiting for your class year.Fall OCI offers many more opportunities for 2L students than 3L students, because most Fall OCI employers are recruiting summer law clerks, and not new associates.But please don't be discouraged!Keep in mind that most law students ultimately work for small to mid-size law firms and government agencies, and those employers typically don't know their hiring needs this far in advance.Most McGeorge students get their jobs through MCO job postings and referrals, though OCI will lead to jobs for a number of you.If you don't see the types of employers you're interested in participating through OCI, meet with a career advisor to design or update your job search strategy\u2014there are many ways to map out the path to your desired job!Employer and Student Perspectives on OCI (video)Hear employer and student perspectives on why you should participate in the OCI process in this video.Utilizing a wide variety of resources and services, we support our students and graduates as they transition to practice and join the ranks of our 13,000+ strong alumni network.McGeorge reports employment data about its graduates to a number of legal organizations, including the American Bar Association (ABA) and the National Association for Law Placement (NALP).The data reported to the ABA and NALP is used byUS News & World Report.These organizations utilize different methodologies, categories, and definitions when they collect and report on employment data.These variations may cause slight differences in their employment reports.The employment outcomes noted below are published in accordance with ABA Accreditation Standard 509.If you have any questions about McGeorge's employment data, please contact the CSO atlawcareers@pacific.eduor 916.739.7011.Class of 2022 ABA Report (pdf)Information on employment outcomes for the Class of 2020 may not reflect a particular law school\u2019s typical results in this area.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, bar admissions exams were canceled or delayed in many jurisdictions, thus making it more challenging for graduates to secure employment by the annual Graduate Employment Status Date of March 15.Please reference the 3 years of employment outcome data posted on theABA Required Disclosures webpageof each ABA-Approved Law School or atwww.abarequireddisclosures.org.Additional StatisticsNote: While this information may be helpful in understanding general employment trends, it cannot provide the full picture of the experience of our graduates or predict future employment outcomes."

in history and a doctor of physical therapy (DPT) from University of Washington.In 2012, he completed a geriatric physical therapy residency at University of Minnesota.He is a certified Geriatric Clinical Specialist.Before pursuing a career in physical therapy, he served in the U.S.Navy.During his time in the Navy he was stationed in Orlando, Florida, Idaho Falls, Idaho and Norfolk, Virginia.Prior to earning his DPT he worked for five years at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.Dr.Gillette is a member of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) and is actively involved in the orthopaedics and education sections, as well as the Academy of Geriatric Physical Therapy.Since 2014, he has been an APTA credentialed clinical instructor.In his role as a faculty member, Dr.Gillette's goal is to help students become outstanding physical therapists and exemplary professionals.He is pursuing his research interests in geriatrics and education.He and his wife have two sons.Together they enjoy hiking, fishing and participating in Cub Scout activities as a family.Dr.Gillette is also an avid photographer.EducationBA in History, University of Washington, 2001DPT, University of Washington, 2009Residency in Geriatric Physical Therapy, University of Minnesota, 2012Teaching InterestsWhen I taught radiation safety to professionals, I intuitively applied Bloom\u2019s taxonomy, albeit roughly.In the decades since, I\u2019ve learned and grown in my understanding of cognitive, psychomotor, and affective learning.My courses involve each of these to varying degrees and depth based on the course content and where the course is in the sequence of the curriculum.I've learned from professors and clinical instructors that there are many ways to facilitate learning.One could ask questions to elicit critical thinking and application, as well as encouraging questions from the student.These questions generally do not exist in a vacuum, but rather are saturated in dialog between the student and teacher.For students who are struggling, sometimes teaching involves encouragement or exhortation while taking into account the students' preferred learning styles.To challenge critical thinking and clinical reasoning, not only is experience vital, but also the encouragement of reflection.I value moving from sage to guide during their two years in the program, evidence-based practice both in my teaching as well as of my teaching, a growth mindset for students and myself, and being student-centered through that.I believe teaching not just facts or techniques, but also why it is important and how to apply it with increasing complexity.I believe not just teaching knowledge or techniques, but also professionalism \u2013 I strive to model lifelong learning, flexibility, a growth mindset, and empathy.As a teacher, I seek feedback from my students as they provide valuable insight into my role as a teacher and as a physical therapist.I've been able to use this to improve professionally, pedagogically, and personally.I have several goals for my students.First, I want them to put the patient first.Second, I want the student and patient to be safe.Third, I want the student to understand the information provided and demonstrate competency.My ultimate goal is that I want my students to think critically and clinically.I don\u2019t want them to just want the answer to a problem such as follow a certain protocol of a certain injury or diagnosis, but be able to think through if the protocol is appropriate and why, and how to apply or modify/adapt it.Research Focus\"Education: I'm interested in various aspects of student learning including the development of empathy during the curriculum, as well as the use of technology in the classroom.\"\"Geriatrics: I'm interested in falls and balance interventions, and the use of technology while working with older adults in the clinic and in the community.\"\"Adherence: I'm interested in how to encourage patients to stick with or perform exercises and how to encourage the community to exercise as a part of their daily lives.\"Research

      "answer": "The sticker price of attending any college or university can be jarring, but that\u2019s not what you\u2019ll be paying out of pocket.Most students who attend Pacific receive financial aid.If you submitted a FAFSA and added University of the Pacific, you were automatically considered for federal grants.If you qualify, they will be listed on your financial aid offer letter.If you haven\u2019t submitted your FAFSA, it\u2019s not too late!Apply atfafsa.ed.gov, and be sure to add Pacific \u2014 our school code is 001329.Apply even if you think you won\u2019t qualify \u2014 you might be surprised!When you applied to Pacific, you were automatically considered for a merit award, which is similar to a grant in that you don\u2019t have to pay it back.These are based on academic achievement.If you qualify for work-study, it also will be listed on your financial aid offer letter.Work-study jobs not only provide income, but you\u2019ll gain experience and make connections!You can find work-study jobs using Handshake, Pacific\u2019s online job board.You might also consider taking out a student loan, but be sure to research the differences between federal and private loans.Students can qualify for federal loans regardless of income that was listed on the FAFSA and generally have better terms.Once you\u2019ve started attending Pacific, be sure to work with your academic advisor, who will help you plan your degree track so you can finish in the least amount of time possible (and thus pay less for college), if that\u2019s what you desire.For more information about the differences between grants, work-study and loans, and more financial aid resources, visitgo.Pacific.edu/FinancialAid."

emailpr@pacific.edu.Our complete policies and information can be found below.FormsApplications are available to students, faculty and other qualified professionals who wish to study the collection.Student Research Request FormFaculty Research Request FormVisiting Scholar Research Request FormPoliciesAccession and Deaccession of Human SkullsThe Atkinson Collection contains over 2400 accessioned human skulls, crania and mandibles.The majority of these individuals were acquired by Dr.Spencer R.Atkinson, an eminent orthodontist and craniofacial researcher, from 1919 to 1963.The University of the Pacific received his private collection in 1963.Subsequent additions have resulted from the dental school's human gross anatomy course during the early 1990s.More recently, a number of dental school alumni have donated skulls that they had purchased from biological supply houses during their dental school days.The Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study (CDHCS) makes every effort to ensure the continued security and preservation of donated skulls.Museum-quality cabinets and archival-quality trays house the Atkinson Collection.Specimens are handled minimally.During research studies involving examination of the skulls, curator assistance is mandatory.Acquisition GuidelinesSkulls donated to CDHCS must be recognizable as originally purchased from a biological supply house (i.e., specimen obviously prepared under laboratory conditions, with tissue removal, degreasing, and bleaching having resulted from standardized preparation techniques) or designated as non-Native American in ethnicity.Subsequent to receipt of a specimen, CDHCS staff may request a 30 day examination period if the specimen's derivation seems questionable.All acquisitions are to be outright and unconditional.Skull donations must be made with the understanding that, while the donor's preference may be taken into consideration, CDHCS staff will determine whether to accession the specimen into the main research collection or into the smaller teaching collection.Federal law prevents CDHCS from providing identification services or appraisal values for donated skulls.Donors are responsible for appraisals of value.Please contact biological supply houses or internet companies specializing in human osteological remains to determine approximate values.CDHCS is in no way affiliated with these organizations.Accession ProcessAccession RecordUpon receipt, the donation will be examined and described for accessioning purposes in an Accession Record.The donor will receive a copy of the Accession Record containing the following:Acquisition information: date received, CDHCS receiver's name, method of delivery of specimen to CDHCS;Donor information: donor's name, address, phone number and email address;Donation information: description of specimen, documentation relating to specimen, accession number and catalogue number(s) assigned;Donor Release statement: \"The objects listed above (and/or on attached list), when accepted by Museum Committee, become the sole and permanent property of Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study of the University of the

accept or reject donation;Name of recipient and date of return, if specimen is returned from CDHCS to donor.DeaccessioningAll donations to CDHCS are irrevocable upon the formal and physical transfer to CDHCS.Subsequent to accession, if a specimen is later deemed to fall outside CDHCS guidelines for acceptance, the donor will be contacted and the specimen deaccessioned and returned to the donor.Conditions Governing Skull LoansThe Spencer R.Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy and the P&S Comparative Anatomy skull collections are open to research by all qualified personnel.At the present

curator) \u2014 $5000.The borrower will be charged for any damage to specimens (see below) incurred during the loan period, including fragmentation of teeth, breakage of bone, and any other form of alteration of the specimens from their original loaned condition.Damage fees will be assessed between $50 - $200 per specimen per incident, based on the severity of the damage and time required for repair by CDHCS staff.Recall of LoanCDHCS reserves the right to recall the loan for any reason and requires return of the recalled loan within three weeks.Transportation/Packing/StorageThe method of transportation of loaned skulls is by hand carry only.The individual researcher, or a designated courier (CDHCS staff, or a professional courier approved by CDHCS and University of the Pacific), will hand carry the skulls to their destination.Each skull will be packed by CDHCS personnel in a loaned skull box with appropriate packing materials prior to transport.The skull boxes and packing material should be stored in appropriate facilities for preservation.The researcher will repack loans in the same or similar material.If a CDHCS staff member or outside professional is chosen as the courier, all courier expenses, including airline tickets, lodging, courier fee (for supervising unpacking, mounting, installation, de-installation, and repacking), and any other unforeseen expenditures will be paid by the borrower.At the designated destination, the researcher will make arrangements necessary for storage of the loaned skulls in a secured room prior to and after use.Care/PreservationThe individual researcher will protect loans from mishandling, dirt, insects, fire, theft, and extreme variations in light, temperature and humidity at all times.Loans will be handled only by the researcher and experienced professional assistants.Specimen handling will be kept to a minimum.The researcher and assistants will comply with all special handling instructions required by CDHCS in the Specimen Handling Guidelines.The researcher will not clean, repair or alter a loaned specimen (see below).CDHCS reserves the right to inspect the installation and/or use of specimens at any time.SecurityFor exhibit purposes, specimens must be displayed in closed, locked cases.For research or commercial purposes, specimens must be placed in closed, locked cases, so as not to be visible when in storage.Damage/LossRegardless of who is responsible, if a borrowed specimen is damaged or lost while in transit, during unpacking or packing, when being examined, measured, photographed, CT scanned, videotaped, or X-rayed, during installation or de-installation of a display, or while on display, the event must be reported immediately by telephone, fax or email to the CDHCS curator.If pieces of teeth or bone are broken off the specimen, every effort must be made to recover those pieces and return them safely to CDHCS along with the specimen.The researcher may not carry out repairs without the permission of the CDHCS curator.Should any incident occur regarding the borrowed specimen, whether or not damage is apparent, the event must be reported immediately and in writing to CDHCS.Examination/Mounting/Installation RestrictionsNo marker, pencil, pen, paint or other marks of any kind may be made on the specimens during measuring, photographing, scanning, videotaping, mounting or installing.No tape, museum wax, dental wax, glue, nails, screws, staples, wires or other materials may be placed on or into the specimens.Exhibit LabelsIf exhibited, the specimen label should include the following credit line: \"Spencer R.Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy, University of the Pacific, Arthur A.Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California\" accompanied by the specimen's catalogue number.Exhibit Publicity and ReproductionsWhile on display, specimens may be photographed for use within the exhibition space itself or for Condition reports.Permission for any other use, such as a publication, or printed or electronic promotional materials (i.e., posters, postcards, booklets, photographs, etc.), or items bearing those images (i.e., gift shop mugs, key chains, etc.), must be received in writing from CDHCS.If the researcher receives permission to make photographs for the purpose of an electronic or print publication or publicity, or item of merchandise, CDHCS requests one set of labeled photos and items for its archives.Photography by the general public is not allowed.Subjecting objects to any artificial or natural light beyond that agreed upon for display purposes requires separate permission from the CDHCS.Catalogue/Publication/Research FindingsIf a publication accompanies the exhibition or results from research, CDHCS requests two copies for its archives.CDHCS also requests copies of promotional materials that contain its specimens.If published, the specimen caption should include the following credit line: \"Spencer R.Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy, University of the Pacific, Arthur A.Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California\" accompanied by the specimen's catalogue number.A report of research findings must be provided to CDHCS at the conclusion of a loan made for research purposes regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.Loan ProcessLoan Approval Letter and Loan AgreementFollowing consideration of the initial loan request by the CDHCS curator, and approval by the museum chairperson and administration representative, the borrower and individual researcher they represent will be notified of the approval, in writing, and provided with an invoice for administrative fees and related costs, if any.An itemized list of specimen insurance values will be included within the letter.Once the borrower has complied with loan agreement conditions, and provided a memorandum and certificate of insurance, the loan agreement will be signed by all parties.Once the loan agreement form is signed, no additions to the specimen list are permitted.Loan FormIn addition to possible formal loan agreement documentation, on the day of the loan the researcher will sign an appropriate loan form that will contain, depending on which type of loan, some portion of the following information: specimen catalogue number(s); value of specimen(s); insuring party; researcher's name, phone number, affiliation and email address; brief description of the purpose of loan; proposed means of transport; anticipated date of return; age of each specimen; loaned condition of each specimen (see Loan Condition Report below); brief summaries of specimen care and handling guidelines, and acknowledgement of conditions governing loans.The loan form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Loan Condition ReportWhen the loan is processed, the CDHCS curator will record the skull condition within the faculty teaching/demonstration loan form, including damaged and/or missing areas of the skull and dentition, and congenital conditions.In signing the loan form, the instructor agrees that the borrowed specimens are received in the recorded condition.Loan Period and Renewal of LoanLoans are generally made for a maximum of six months.Requests for renewal must be made in writing to the curator and received 30 days before the expiration of the loan.The loan will be reviewed by the curator, museum committee, and administration representative if more than two renewal requests are submitted.Return of LoanThe researcher agrees to return the loan only to the CDHCS curator, by the date specified in the signed loan agreement, unless other arrangements are agreed to in advance by CDHCS.Loan FeesLoan Handling FeeResearch and exhibit loans are not subject to the administrative loan handling fee.Commercial use loans are subject to the administrative loan handling fee and will be charged a flat rate of $200 per specimen borrowed.This fee covers the cost of locating specimens, producing a loan condition report, processing forms, and packing, receiving and returning specimens to storage.Additional fees apply to commercial use loans that result in product development and distribution, as indicated in the Production of Images section.Loan Request Cancellation FeeOnce a formal loan request has been received from a non-UOP researcher, and review by CDHCS staff has begun, if the loan request is cancelled, withdrawn or postponed indefinitely by the researcher, a loan request cancellation fee of $50 will be charged to the borrower, whether the loan request was made on behalf of a prospective research project, exhibit or for commercial use.In addition, should the commercial use borrower cancel a loan request after a cost, such as the loan handling fee, has been incurred by CDHCS on behalf of the borrower, the borrower is responsible for that cost.InterpretationIn the event of any conflict between this agreement and any forms of the borrower, the terms of this agreement shall be controlling.Research Access to Skull CollectionsResearch RequestsThe Spencer R.Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy (Atkinson Collection) and P&S Comparative Anatomy collections are open to research by all qualified personnel.Access to the collections is by appointment only.Appointments are scheduled by the CDHCS curator upon receipt of a written statement of research objectives and data collection methods.(See links to research request forms at the top of this page.) All research requests should be emailed toCDHCScurator@pacific.eduon institutional letterhead addressed to:CDHCS CuratorUniversity of the PacificArthur A.Dugoni School of Dentistry155 Fifth StreetSan Francisco, CA 94103A report of research findings must be provided to the CDHCS curator at the conclusion of a research study regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.University of the Pacific Faculty and Students, and Visiting ScholarsTo gain research access to the skull collections, please complete the appropriate Research Request application available at this site (see Forms), or request an application form from the CDHCS curator.Research Approval ProcessFor adequate review and scheduling, research requests must be submitted at least three months in advance by visiting scholars and one month in advance by dental school faculty and students.Proposed visit date(s) and study duration will be discussed at the time of research request submission to determine the feasibility of dates and times.Following consideration and approval of the research request by the CDHCS curator, the researcher will be notified of the approval in writing.Research ConditionsResearchersResearch permission is granted only to faculty and students of the University of the Pacific, to visiting scholars affiliated with academic institutions and to medical and dental professionals.Research Use FormOn the day of the visit, the researcher will sign a Research Use Form that contains the following information: Researcher's name, phone number, affiliation or professional address, email address, a brief description of conditions governing research use, and a list of specimens examined.The Research Use Form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Designated Research AreaResearch study of the skull collections by University of the Pacific faculty and students, and by visiting scholars must take place at the Arthur A.Dugoni School of Dentistry in the CDHCS's designated research area.Special permission must be obtained to transport specimens to nearby facilities, inside or outside the dental school, for photographing, X-raying or CT scanning.Specimen SelectionTo facilitate the sample selection process, an on-site Atkinson database is now available for use by researchers.Pre-selection of skulls using images and information in the database will minimize the visitor's need to survey the collection itself, an activity CDHCS discourages due to collection preservation concerns.If preferable, based on the objectives of the study and in consultation with the researcher, the CDHCS curator will select a specific or random sample of specimens from the skull collection.Care and PreservationThe curator will do most of the handling of the specimens, retrieving them from the storage cabinets for study and returning them after examination is completed.In this manner the potential for damage to the specimens is minimized.On the first day of the study, the researcher will be asked to read CDHCS's Procedural Advice for Handling Skulls guidelines and to sign a research form.There are no restrictions on the number of specimens available for study.Research FeesCurrently there are no research fees charged to students and faculty, or to visiting scholars.Teaching Access to Skull CollectionsTeaching
