Jeannette Powell served as a Regent from 1999 until her death in 2012. She is the only person to have been granted lifetime Regent status. Robert Powell passed away the same year the program was founded, but Jeannette Powell remained passionately involved until her passing in 2012.The Powells have provided our students with unprecedented opportunities to fulfill their individual goals and to work collectively toward realizing the Powells' vision for the Program which, in Jeannette’s memorable words, is to “find and follow your passions.”Social MediaInstagramNewsPacific prepares to celebrate Class of 2023 at all-university commencementRead MoreFaculty members honored for mentorship by Alumni AssociationRead MoreContact UsAssoc.

We intend to serve as an objective, unbiased resource that beneficiaries can rely upon in getting accurate information about Medicare Part D plan offerings.The need for these events is ongoing, as Medicare Part D plan offerings change each year, as do the formulary and cost-sharing structure of each plan. Students also provide Medication Therapy Management, a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's medications to ensure they are safe and effective to take together. If needed (and with permission from the patient), we will contact the beneficiary's physician and/or pharmacist and share with them our findings and make specific recommendations.Medicare Open Enrollment:October 15 – December 7During this window of time, beneficiaries can change their Medicare Part D drug plan. If you need help with selecting a Part D plan or want to ensure your current plan is the ‘best’ one for you, please attend one of our virtual community outreach events.Medicare Part D Outreach Clinics Patient ImpactPlay VideoMake an appointmentAppointments are highly recommended for Part D and medication review services.

On average, ~75% beneficiaries can save money on their drug plan costs by examining all available choices. On average, Medicare beneficiaries can save $1,014 per year by optimizing their Part D plan.Can you help me select the Medicare Part D plan that is right for me?Yes! We will evaluate all of the Medicare Part D plans you are eligible for and identify the one which will minimize your out-of-pocket expenses. We can also identify if you may qualify for additional governmental assistance to help lower your out-of-pocket prescription medications.What is Medication Therapy Management (MTM)?We will review all of your medications to make sure that they are safe to take together and answer any questions that you may have. If we have concerns, we can directly contact your prescriber and/or pharmacist to share our recommendations.Can I attend my Part D and/or medication review intervention with my spouse or family member so we can both be assisted together?Absolutely! When you make an appointment please indicate that both of you will need an intervention and on the day of the event the two of you will be placed into the same intervention. While doing this will increase the length of the intervention, we are happy to accommodate this type of request.When should I sign up for my appointment?It is best to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. This will ensure that you are able to find a day and time that works best for you. We anticipate that we will have a full house at most events this year.Will you still be able to be assist me if I don’t schedule an appointment this year?Yes, if you attend our IN-PERSON events, but wait times may vary. For all VIRTUAL events, scheduling an appointment is REQUIRED, not recommended. This is due to the intricacies of the telehealth interventions that we will be performing this year. We hope you understand.How long should I expect the Part D and/or medication review intervention to last?As in year’s past, we will take as long as needed to ensure that you receive the care that you need. We will do our best to be efficient with your time but will never rush and compromise your care. On average, we expect that the length of the intervention for someone who wants both Part D and medication review services will take 1 hour and 15 minutes. For those only wanting one of the two services, the average length of the intervention would be closer to 45 minutes. If you are joined in your room by a friend/family member also needing help, this will lengthen the intervention.Should I be concerned with my personal information being leaked by using telehealth services?We have been working closely with our Information Technology department and local experts on ways to ensure privacy of our interventions and to protect these sessions. We have several safeguards in place to ensure that this is the case. Your privacy is our number one concern and we will do our best to never compromise your trust.Can I get a flu shot or other vaccines at this year’s clinics?Yes, but only at our IN-PERSON events.What additional services do you offer at your events?At our IN-PERSON events, we will be offering diabetes screening (hemoglobin A1C, blood glucose), bone density testing, falls risk assessment, blood pressure testing, cholesterol testing, anemia testing, depression screening, anxiety screening, insomnia screening and memory decline screening. We will also be offering flu, pneumonia, shingles, Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis/whooping cough) and Hepatitis B vaccinations at all clinics.How can I safely dispose of sharps?Learn more by downloading the Sharps and Opioids Disposal Locations PDF.Sharps and Opioids Disposal Locations (PDF)By studying at University of the Pacific, you’ll join a community of scholars who go on to excel in their dream careers and earn higher salaries than their peers from other Californian institutions.The pathway to a better career starts here.Accelerate your career in 40+ graduate programs with world-class instruction, cutting-edge lab research, classroom practicums, field studies and internships.Explore Graduate ProgramsAccounting, MAccAdvanced Education in General Dentistry, AEGDAthletic Training, MSAudiology, AuDBehavioral Psychology, MABiological Sciences, MSBusiness Administration, MBABusiness Analytics, MSClinical Nutrition, MSCommunication, MAComputer Science, MSCounseling Psychology, PsyDCybersecurity, MSData Science, MSDental Surgery, DDSEducation, MA - Counseling PsychologyEducation, MA - Learning, Innovation and DesignEducation, MA - TeachingEducation, EdS - School PsychologyEducation, EdD - Leadership & InnovationEducation, EdD - Transformative Action in EducationEndodontics, MSDEngineering, MSFinance, MSGraduate CertificatesHealth, Exercise & Sport Sciences, MAHealth Science, DHScInternational Dental Studies, DDSJuridical Science, JSDJuris Doctor, JDLaw, MSLaw, LLMLeadership, MA - Leading for Social JusticeLeadership, MA - Organizational Innovation & ChangeMedical Science, DMScMusic Education, MMMusic Therapy, MANursing, Entry Level MSNOccupational Therapy, OTDOrthodontics, MSDPharmaceutical & Chemical Sciences, MS/PhDPharmacy, PharmDPhysical Therapy, DPTPhysician Assistant Studies, MPASPublic Administration, MPAPublic Policy, MPPSocial Work, MSWSpeech-Language Pathology, MSHow to applySelect your Graduate or Professional path to get started:GraduateDentalLawPharmacyWhen to applyFind your program's application deadline below:Graduate, Law, and PharmacyDentistryWhat to submitApplication materials vary by program, and may include:Official TranscriptsStandardized Test ScoresLetters of RecommendationAll programs require a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution of higher education in the United States or a foreign institution of acceptable standing.

ScholarshipsLoansBlogResourcesAboutScholarshipsLoansBlogResourcesAboutLoginRegisterHow to Refinance a Student Loan: Options for International BorrowersSeptember 28th, 2023 by IEFARefinancing your international student loans can be a game-changer in managing your student loan debt more efficiently and potentially reducing the amount of interest you pay by thousands of dollars. But, what are the steps to refinance, and what challenges do international students face in this process? In this blog post, we’ll uncover the benefits of refinancing for international borrowers, discuss the challenges and provide actionable steps on how to refinance a student loan, helping you take control of your financial future.Key takeawaysRefinancing student loans can provide international students with better loan terms and help reduce the amount they pay in fees and interest.International students must consider credit score, repayment terms, lender fees and eligibility requirements before refinancing.Students can find lenders with competitive interest rates and build a U.S. credit history when they make timely payments.Contents:Understanding student loan refinancingInternational student loan refinancing challengesEligibility requirements for refinancing student loansSteps to refinance your international student loanTop lenders for international student loan refinancingBuilding your credit history in the U.S.Additional options for international borrowersFrequently asked questionsUnderstanding student loan refinancingWhen you refinance your student loans, you secure a new loan from a lender to settle your current student loan debt. This new loan comes with different terms such as lower interest rates or reduced monthly payments, which could reduce the amount you pay over the life of the loan and potentially help you get out of debt faster. It’s an excellent solution for international students who want to change the terms of their international student loan and take advantage of better loan terms.However, refinancing isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Before embarking on the process, you need to evaluate your financial situation, compare lenders and offers and familiarize yourself with eligibility requirements. The good news is there are excellent lenders like MPOWER Financing, SoFi and Citizens Bank that specialize in international student loan refinancing.What is refinancing?Refinancing is the process of obtaining a new loan to pay off an existing one, often with the goal of securing a lower interest rate or reducing monthly payments. For international students, refinancing can be an opportunity to release a cosigner and consolidate multiple loans into one, making it easier to keep track of payments and manage your finances.Building a solid credit score in the U.S. may enable you to qualify for better rates on refinanced loans, thus reducing the amount you pay in interest every month. Keep in mind that not all lenders provide student loan refinancing for international students, so it’s essential to research and understand your options.How refinancing worksRefinancing student loans involves a new lender paying off your existing loan(s) with a new loan. Your new loan will have different terms and a potentially more favorable interest rate. When you’re thinking about refinancing your student loans, it’s crucial to carefully examine the new interest rate, repayment terms and any fees the new lender might charge. By doing so, you can ensure refinancing is the best move for your financial future.International student loan refinancing challengesRefinancing international student loans comes with a unique set of challenges. Many lenders may not offer refinancing options for international students or may have stringent requirements making it difficult for them to qualify.Limited credit historyA significant challenge faced by international students when attempting to refinance their student loans is having a limited or nonexistent U.S. credit history. Most lenders rely on credit histories and scores to make underwriting decisions, which can make it difficult for international students to get approved for refinancing.Nonetheless, if you start building a U.S. credit history now, you can enhance your chances of refinancing in the future and qualify for superior loan terms. Most U.S. lenders report payment history to credit bureaus, and you can develop a credit history by:Opening a secured or unsecured credit card account.Financing a larger purchase, such as a car or an appliance.Making timely payments.Temporary visa statusTemporary visa status can also pose a challenge for international students when refinancing their student loans. Not all lenders have the ability to service and collect on loans internationally, and they may not be able to approve noncitizens on temporary visas, making it more difficult to find refinancing options.Eligibility requirements for refinancing student loansTo qualify for student loan refinancing, you typically need to meet certain eligibility requirements, such as:Having a history of making debt payments on time.Having a steady income.Having a low debt-to-income ratio.Having good or excellent credit.Understanding these requirements in depth and evaluating your financial status are crucial to determine if refinancing is a viable option for you.Stable employment and incomeHaving stable employment and income is a key factor when it comes to student loan refinancing. Lenders want to ensure you have the means to repay the loan, so they require proof of steady income and employment. By providing pay stubs, tax returns and bank statements, you can demonstrate your financial stability and increase your chances of approval for refinancing.Building a strong credit history in the U.S. can also improve your chances of qualifying for better refinancing terms and interest rates.Debt-to-income ratioAnother important factor in determining your eligibility for refinancing is your debt-to-income ratio. This ratio compares your monthly debt payments to your gross monthly income and is calculated by dividing your total monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income.A debt-to-income ratio of less than 43% is considered optimal for refinancing, as it indicates you have a manageable debt load and are more likely to be approved for refinancing.Good credit scoreA good credit score is essential for qualifying for better loan terms and interest rates when refinancing your student loans. Most lenders require a minimum credit score of 690 to refinance a student loan.Steps to refinance your international student loanRefinancing your international student loan involves following a series of steps to ensure a successful application and approval process. These steps include:Assessing your financial situation.Comparing lenders and offers.Preparing necessary documentation.Submitting your application.Monitoring progress.Assess your financial situationBefore embarking on the refinancing process, it is vital to evaluate your financial status to decide if refinancing aligns with your needs. This involves taking a close look at your current income, debt-to-income ratio and credit score to get a comprehensive overview of your financial health.By evaluating your current financial picture, you can determine if you qualify for a lower interest rate or lower monthly payments and understand the potential savings and benefits of refinancing.Compare lenders and offersAfter evaluating your financial status, the next step involves comparing different lenders and their offers to identify the most optimal refinancing option. This involves researching and evaluating the interest rates, repayment terms and other features of different lenders.By comparing these factors, you can make an informed decision about which lender and refinancing option is most suitable for your financial situation and goals.Prepare necessary documentationOnce you’ve selected the most suitable lender and refinancing option, the next move is to compile the requisite documentation for your application. This may include:Recent pay stubs or proof of employment.Tax documents.Valid identification documents.Loan statements.Having all of this documentation readily available will make the application process smoother and increase your chances of approval.Submit your application and monitor progressThe final step in the refinancing journey involves:Submitting your application.Tracking its progress.Proactively communicating with the lender.Providing any additional information or documentation they may require.Staying on top of your application and maintaining open communication with the lender will help ensure a successful refinancing process and potentially save you time and money in the long run.Top lenders for international student loan refinancingSeveral leading student loan refinance lenders offer options to refinance international student loans specifically designed for international borrowers.

Their services include:Loans specifically designed for international students.Refinancing options with competitive APRs.Eligibility requirements that can help international students reach their goals more easily.MPOWER Financing is an excellent option for international students who may not have a U.S. credit history or a U.S. citizen cosigner.SoFiSoFiis a personal finance company that provides a range of financial products and services, including:Student loan refinancing options for nonpermanent resident aliens, U.S. citizens and permanent residents.Competitive interest rates.A variety of refinancing options to suit your needs.In addition to refinancing, SoFi provides free financial advice from a certified financial planner and free career coaching, helping you take control of your financial future.Citizens BankCitizens Bankis another lender that offers refinancing options for international students. Their refinancing options come with:Competitive interest rates.The freedom to choose your repayment terms.These features make Citizens Bank an attractive option for international students looking to refinance their student loans.We must note that refinanced loans from Citizens Bank do not qualify for the formal forbearance policy – a critical point to remember.Building your credit history in the U.S.Establishing a strong U.S. credit history is crucial for international students who want to improve their chances of approval for refinancing. Building credit in the U.S. involves:Using secured credit cards.Making timely bill payments.Monitoring your credit report to ensure your credit history accurately reflects your financial behavior.Adopting these measures can elevate your credit score and enhance your financial position, simplifying the process of qualifying for refinancing and potentially enabling access to better loan terms.Secured credit cardsOne way for international students to establish a credit history in the U.S. is by using secured credit cards. Secured credit cards require a cash security deposit, which acts as collateral and reduces the risk for the lender.By using these cards responsibly and making on-time payments, international students can demonstrate their creditworthiness and build a positive credit history in the U.S. This, in turn, can help them qualify in the future for other types of credit, such as student loan refinancing.Timely bill paymentsPaying bills on time is another essential component in building a strong credit history and improving credit scores. Consistently making timely bill payments demonstrates to lenders that you are responsible with your finances, which can help you build a strong credit history.You can ensure timely bill payments by setting up automatic payments, setting reminders and budgeting for bills, which will help you stay on top of your finances and avoid late fees.Monitoring your credit reportRegularly monitoring your credit report is crucial in building and maintaining a strong credit history. By keeping an eye on your credit report, you can spot errors, identify areas for improvement and track your progress in building credit.If you find any errors in your credit report, you should dispute them with the appropriate credit bureaus to ensure your credit history accurately reflects your financial behavior.Additional options for international borrowersAlternative financing solutions are available for international borrowers who might not meet the qualifications for conventional refinancing options. Exploring these additional options can help you find the most suitable solution for your unique needs and financial circumstances.Personal loansPersonal loans can be a viable option for international borrowers looking to pay off their private student loans with a more favorable interest rate. These loans are typically provided by banks, credit unions or online lenders and can be used for various purposes, including paying off student loans.To qualify for a personal loan, you typically need a reliable source of income, a healthy debt-to-income ratio and good credit, but the exact requirements may be different from a dedicated refinancing product. By comparing personal loan offers and carefully evaluating interest rates and repayment terms, you can determine if a personal loan is a suitable alternative to refinancing your student loans.Family or friend loansBorrowing from family or friends may be an option if you are unable to qualify for traditional refinancing solutions. While this option can provide you with the funds you need, it’s essential to establish clear written terms and repayment plans to avoid potential financial and relationship complications.By setting a repayment plan, interest rate and any other relevant terms upfront, you can ensure a successful family or friend loan that benefits and protects both you and the lender.SummaryRefinancing your international student loans can be a powerful tool in managing your student loan debt and potentially reducing the amount of interest you pay by thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. By understanding the benefits, challenges and steps involved in the refinancing process, and considering top lenders like MPOWER Financing, SoFi and Citizens Bank, you can take control of your financial future. As you navigate the world of refinancing, remember to explore all available options, including building a U.S. credit history, enlisting a co-signer and considering alternative financing solutions, to find the best refinancing solution for your unique needs.Frequently asked questionsIs it hard to get student loans refinanced?Getting student loans refinanced is not easy, as you typically need good credit and a steady income to qualify.

Merit scholarships are an excellent way to fund your college education. These merit awards can help relieve some of the financial burdens that often accompany a college education, allowing students to focus on their academic success and personal growth.Merit scholarships come in many forms, from generous scholarships offered by colleges and universities to partial awards provided by private organizations and foundations. To help find the right one for you, let’s dive deeper into the criteria and types of merit scholarships available.Criteria for Merit ScholarshipsThe criteria for merit scholarships can vary and generally revolves around a few key factors. Your grade point average (GPA) is often a significant consideration with the minimum requirement usually starting at 3.0, although this may vary. In addition to your GPA, standardized test scores, such as SAT or ACT results, are commonly considered as well.Beyond academic achievements, merit scholarships also consider your extracurricular activities and demonstrated leadership skills. For example, serving as an officer or team captain in student organizations, sports, honor societies, community groups or jobs can showcase your leadership abilities and increase your chances of securing a merit scholarship. So, make sure you give equal weight to both your academic performance and extracurricular involvement when applying for merit scholarships.Types of Merit ScholarshipsThere are several types of merit scholarships available to talented students with a wide range of interests and achievements.

I often ask students to offer brief presentations that pose observations, ask questions, or contribute knowledge and further context to our reading. I encourage student participation on multiple levels. For example, students formulate final projects and demonstrate their abilities to design, organize, and carry out assignments that began as intellectual curiosities. On numerous occasions, students have pursued these curiosities further by undertaking independent research projects.In all my courses, careful and close reading is a principal component of our work together. Sometimes the most fruitful class sessions have occurred when we have abandoned the task of "covering the material" and, instead, have yielded to the force of the words on the page, slowly reading and rereading, meditating on a single phrase or word—tracing its rich etymological and philological meanings. These have been moments of pedagogical and intellectual grace.As Edward Said reminds us in one of his final books, Humanism and Democratic Criticism (2004), philology was practiced by some of the most radical and intellectually audacious minds of the last 150 years.  It is this radical audacity that I hope to inspire in students.Research FocusEarly and 19th century American Literature, World Literature, Criticism and Theory, Law and Literature, U.S. Empire, Liberalism and Neoliberalism.I have essayed on a range of topics addressing transnational American studies; slavery, sentiment, and empire; the enforcement of fugitive slave law; as well as the role of humanistic literary criticism in the of wake of neoliberal economic practices.

High school students may be interested in anticipating some college education, however, in order to facilitate their adjustment to college or to save money by satisfying college course requirements.Advanced courses taken while in high school can sometimes interfere negatively with the college curriculum. The items below categorize courses by the type of interaction that they have with the curriculum of the Pre-Dental Advantage Program.Green light classes. AP, IB or college courses taken in high school (early college) may be used to satisfy requirements of the general education portion (except science) of the Pre-Dental Advantage Program, as long as they can be transferred as equivalent to courses at Pacific that satisfy such requirements. This equivalence can be verified at theROAR webpage. Courses in chemistry and biology may be a good preparation for college when they do not articulate with a Pacific course or when they articulate with Pacific courses that have code numbers lower than BIOL 51 for biology (ex: BIOL 41) or lower than CHEM 25 for chemistry (ex: CHEM23).Yellow light classes. AP, IB or early college classes are acceptable for physics courses that articulate with PHYS 23, 25, 53 or 55 but it is recommended that physics be taken instead at Pacific.Red light classes. AP, IB or early college classes cannot be used to reduce the number of chemistry and biology courses taken while in the Pre-Dental Advantage Program. If you complete a core biology or chemistry course before enrolling at Pacific, you will be required to take a more advanced course in those subjects at Pacific. If you have already taken or want to take these courses, you should inform your undergraduate admission counselor at Pacific and request the transfer of your courses to Pacific.

And that means keeping things interesting for a range of students with varying skills, learning styles, and backgrounds. I therefore incorporate in my classes a variety of strategies and formats in an effort to reach all of my students, allowing them to make the most of their abilities; I choose readings that are not too dry or technical; I incorporate images and videos into lectures, both so students can better recall course content and so they can place themselves in the shoes of political actors to better understand their decisions; I use humor and other tactics during class to draw students away from other options such as checking social media or getting in a short nap; I tell personal anecdotes during lectures to illustrate complex theories and include real world case studies to bring difficult concepts to life; I invite students try to answer the questions other students, or I, ask; and I have students do small group work in class to grapple with the material.A major goal for each course is for students to leave with a depth of knowledge and skills related to course content. However, my main aim is for students to walk out of my classroom and into the world with the ability to apply what they have learned about political science or intercultural studies in their day to day lives because, in the end, most of their interactions in life will be both political and intercultural.Research FocusMy research analyzes the politics of economic globalization and the effects of political institutions on the choices of domestic actors, such as politicians, voters, and businesspeople in developing states. I am particularly interested in the interplay of the forces of economic globalization and the political institutions that comprise regime type in Asia. Two examples are my papers "Playing Risk: Chinese Foreign Direct Investment in Cambodia" (2014) inContemporary Southeast Asiaand"Risky Business: The Political Economy of Chinese Investment in Kazakhstan" (2014) in theJournal of Eurasian Studies. In these I analyze how China uses aid and loans to influence foreign governments in order to protect Chinese investments in developing states with high political risk and corruption. I have also published papers on the effects of changes to political institutions on election outcomes in Taiwan, "Electoral Rules and the Democratic Progressive Party's Performance in the 2004 and 2008 Legislative Elections in Taiwan" (2012) in theJournal of Asian and African Studiesand on the impact of regime type on the ability of developing states to borrow money,"Transparent Motives: The Democratic Advantage in International Credit Markets" (2017)Journal of International Relations and Development, with my SIS colleague Yong Kim.My book,Dividing ASEAN and Conquering the South China Sea: China's Financial Power Projection(2018,https://www.hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1700.php) investigates China's efforts to thwart the ability of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to act collectively in negotiating with the more powerful Chinese over rival territorial claims in the South China Sea. I show how China can do so by using its foreign aid, loans and investment to influence just one ASEAN member to support China's preference for bilateral negotiations with rival claimants rather than multilateral negotiations with a united ASEAN. I conclude that regime type, specifically more authoritarian political institutions, provide avenues for Chinese influence over governments in developing states, but democratic institutions mitigate that influence, thereby constraining China's global power projection.My current projects include a journal article and a co-edited book on the politics of China's Belt and Road Initiative.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave. university choices with small collegecaringExplore Academic OpportunitiesNext —Learning EnvironmentLearning EnvironmentA New England campus in the heart of Northern CaliforniaSchedule a Campus TourNext —Practical ExperiencePractical ExperienceBuild confidence and createyour futureDiscover real-world opportunitiesNext —Devoted EducationDevoted EducationAn educationthat earnsSee Alumni OutcomesNext —Personalized PathwaysApply Now for Fall 2024Unleash your potential and shape your future with us this Fall 2024!

Being born and raised in Stockton, I wanted to be able to continue to give back and support my local community while in college.Also, the reputation of the Eberhardt School of Business and their accounting program, specifically the Master of Accounting (MAcc) program really appealed to me when I realized I could receive my master’s degree in five years or less. Higher education is important in my family, and I am proud to be a third-generation Pacific Tiger.As an accounting major, what has your Pacific experience been like?The accounting courses I have taken have laid the foundation for my internships, as well as my future professional career. These courses gave me the basic knowledge and information.The Dean’s Seminar in my freshman year and the Career Seminar taught by director of the ESB Career Center Margaret Roberts during my junior year, really encouraged me to put together my resume, participate in mock internships and to network with professionals in the accounting industry.My hands-on experience came through the internships.You mentioned internships, could you tell us more about it?In the summer of 2020, I was an intern at Farmers & Merchants Bank of Central California. I gained some great hands-on experience because I worked there during the Paycheck Protection Program which offered assistance to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.After my internship, I was able to stay on as a part-time employee in the bank’s payroll department. Then in January 2022, I started a tax internship with Moss Adams in Stockton. I learned so much during this internship. I got first-hand experience of what it’s like for accountants during tax season.What is Pacific’s MAcc program?Pacific’s MAcc Program is the Master of Accounting Program at the Eberhardt School of Business. It is a blended undergrad/graduate program that allows students the opportunity to fulfill the 150-unit requirement for the certified public accountant (CPA) exam. Many students can complete this program in four-and-a-half to five years.Not only does it set you up for success when taking the CPA exam, it also gives you the foundation to enter the professional workplace.What are the benefits of this program?It is two extra semesters, in addition to your undergraduate years. MAcc is built so there is an easy transition from the undergraduate accounting program into the graduate program. If someone were to do their master’s degree at another school, they would have to take the GMAT, submit an application with letters of recommendation, and then it would be a minimum of two years of graduate courses.A huge benefit of MAcc is that you are with the same group of classmates all the way through graduation. This is extremely helpful when working on group projects or studying for exams.How would you describe your Pacific experience?I have really enjoyed my time at Pacific. It has been rewarding, challenging and adaptable. During spring break 2020, we had to make the transition to online learning due to COVID-19 pandemic and both students and faculty were so flexible and adaptable.Before that, I was a member of the Pacific Women Tennis Team for three years. Athletics allowed me to see another side of campus that most students do not get to be a part of. Being a student athlete really set me up for success by sharpening my skills in teamwork and determination.What can you say about your Pacific professors?One of Pacific’s best assets is the professors. They really care about you not only as a student, but as a young professional entering the workforce. The small class sizes allow the professor for more one-on-one help in class or during office hours, and most of them are easy to get a hold of.My favorite thing about the Eberhardt School professors is that they come from very different backgrounds and are eager to share their diverse experiences. I especially enjoyed stories we got to hear from professors Thomas Brierton and Robert Eger.What is next for you?I plan to continue working through my accounting program, complete my current three-month internship with the accounting firm, Moss Adams, and return to F&M Bank where I will work in the controller’s department. Both my educational and work experience will set me up for great success as I near graduation in 2023 and begin to study for the CPA exam.In the long-term, I hope to work in the banking industry or for a small/midsize accounting firm.HousingApply for Housing — Returning StudentsHousing and DiningHousing OptionsSacramento Campus HousingSan Francisco Campus HousingStockton Campus HousingApply for HousingNew and Transfer StudentsReturning StudentsDining ServicesCurrent StudentsDirectoryWe’re excited for you to live on campus.Whether you lived with us last year or are a current student looking to live on campus for the first time, we are glad you’re here.

You work tirelessly to set up your advisees for success and mentor them through one of the toughest and most stressful parts of their lives so far: applying to health professions programs. You support them, motivate them and push them to be better students, and to become the professionals who will eventually serve the public as our health practitioners—including the next generation of dentists and allied dental professionals.As a health professions advisor, you wear many hats. You are probably advising for multiple health professions, involved in mentoring student groups and have lots of different letters of evaluation to write.The dental profession is growing, and the field is one that draws motivated, intelligent and creative students toward a stable service-oriented career. And with population growth, changes in health care law and the upcoming retirement of a large group of dentists educated during the 960s and 1970s, the need for new dentists is rapidly increasing. Now more than ever, it is important to encourage a diverse group of students to apply to dental school in order to meet the evolving oral health needs of a diverse society.We recognize how hard you work to help your students fulfill their dreams, and the role that you play in molding the future of oral health services. We want to provide you with information to help you advise your students interested in going to dental school. In this section you will find information about the application to dental school, the dental profession, and guides on how to best assist your students throughout the application process.TheADEA AADSAS Health Professions Advisor Portalhelps you to counsel and guide your students through the application process, by allowing you to track your students’ progress within the application.Additionally, you can create reports that demonstrate your institution’s success in helping students get into dental school, and you can use the metrics the portal provides to inform your plans for advising students in subsequent application cycles.Advisors for current applicants:log in to theUniversal Advisor Portal.

StudentsHealth Professions Advisor ViewsEventsUpcoming EventsEnrichment Programs CalendarPast EventsInformation for:Future DentistsFuture Dental HygienistsNontraditional ApplicantsHealth Professions AdvisorsHomeMoney MattersFinancing optionsFinancing optionsYour first and most important contact for information on paying for dental school is your school’s Financial Aid Office (FAO). They are the best source of information regarding ways to pay for dental school.In general, two types of financial assistance are available to dental school students:Gift assistance (grants and scholarships) andStudent loans.Gift AssistanceGift assistance in the form of grants and scholarships is your best financing option because these funds never have to be repaid, thus every dollar you receive in gift assistance is a dollar you may not need to borrow. Grants and scholarships directly from the school may be based on need or merit, or a combination of these. Some scholarships are tied to a service commitment; for example, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) and the Armed Forces. Check with the FAO at your institution about the availability of grants and scholarships and important deadlines for applying for these opportunities.In general, there are three categories of grants and scholarships to consider:Institutional Grants and ScholarshipsThese are based on need and/or merit. Check with your school’s FAO about applications and deadlines.Outside ScholarshipsThese are awarded by organizations other than the school.You must apply for these independently.Use free search engines, such as www.fastweb.com, or visit organization websites, such as ADEA, to find outside scholarships; it is not necessary to conduct a paid search for outside scholarships.Report receipt of these scholarships to your FAO, as your total financial aid, including outside scholarships, from all sources can never exceed your total cost of attendance (COA).Service Commitment ScholarshipsProvide financial support while you are in school in exchange for your service after graduation.These are similar to loan repayment programs except you make the commitment earlier and receive the funds earlier, thereby helping reduce how much you borrow or eliminate borrowing altogether.The Armed Forces, NHSC and Indian Health Service offer programs. Your FAO can help with additional information, including application deadlines.Student LoansUnlike grants and scholarships, student loans must be repaid. The majority of dental students use student loans to help pay for dental school. The most common types of loans used by dental students are the federal direct unsubsidized loan and the federal direct PLUS (formerly known as Grad PLUS). Dental school graduates have a great reputation for responsible and timely repayment. Make sure you understand thedifferent types of loansand the benefits and downsides of each before applying for them. Once again, your FAO can help.You might be interested in...ResourcesWhen determining how to finance your dental education, it is important to do a lot of research and be informed of all your financing options.Financing Your Dental EducationTake a look at the top 10 questions every incoming dental school student should ask about financing their dental education.:Future DentistsFuture Dental HygienistsNontraditional ApplicantsHealth Professions AdvisorsHomeDentistry 101Is dentistry right for you?Is dentistry right for you?Do you like working with your hands, helping people, being creative and being a leader? Well, then you might make a great dentist!While a career in dentistry may sound appealing to you, it is important that you are genuinely passionate about oral health—dental school and careers in dentistry are both very demanding, so it takes determined people to achieve success in pursuing their dreams. The best dentists saw dentistry as their true calling and are constantly working to improve themselves and their abilities.If you are interested in a career in dentistry, make sure to do some soul searching before plunging head first into the application process. Another great way to figure out if dentistry is right for you is to shadow a dentist or specialist. The experience will allow you to actually envision yourself doing what he or she does every day. If after this process this sounds appealing, then dentistry is probably the right fit for you!You might be interested in...Why be a dentist?A flexible lifestyle, being your own boss and making a real contribution to the health of your patients are just some of the many reasons why people choose dentistry as a profession.Need for diversityIf you are someone who is part of an underrepresented minority group and you have an interest in dentistry, you can help contribute to a future where all patients receive the same quality of care and understanding.ShadowingDental schools like to see applicants with shadowing experience, and shadowing a dentist is a crucial part of confirming your decision to become a dentist.Why be a dentist?Is dentistry right for you?What dental school demandsWhat a career in dentistry demandsThe admissions processADEA AADSAS ApplicationApplication to Dental School2023–24 Application Cycle UpdatesApplication InstructionsRefund PolicyRe-ApplicantsSchool-Specific DeadlinesDental School InterviewNew!

Are they based on need, merit, or both?Are there any separate forms or applications to complete? What are the submission deadlines?Does the FAO require parental information in the application in order to be considered for any campus-based grants, scholarships, or loans?What is the first-yearcost of attendance (COA)/financial aid budget? What is the expected monthly living allowance?Are additional types of financial aid available through the school, such as work-study programs, traineeships, or fellowships?Are there summer internships or other paid research or work opportunities for incoming dental students during the summer before school starts?Does the school keep a list of current students or alumni who are using or have used service scholarships, such as the National Health Service Corps or armed forces, to help them fund their dental school educations?Complete theFree Application for Federal Student Aid(FAFSA).You must complete the FAFSA to be considered for any kind of federal financial aid and most types of school assistance. Check with your FAO about deadlines, as recent changes in financial aid allow students to submit the FAFSA earlier than in past years, though dental schools may have their own deadlines.If you have any outstanding student loans, get your financial aid records in order.Contact your loan servicer(s) and ensure that they have your up-to-date contact information, including mailing and email addresses and phone number. Be sure they know when and where you are starting dental school and your expected graduation date.Go toStudentAid.govand after you log in, look for your “dashboard” where you should see a listing of any outstanding federal student loans you have. You should also be able to find your current loan servicer(s) for federal student loans here.Be sure to check the status of private loans you may have from college or postbaccalaureate programs. While such loans may be deferred during dental school, it is important to know when they will come due.Set up both paper and electronic files to keep all financial aid-related documents, including:Copies of any financial aid award letters or notices from the FAO.Copies of your Master Promissory Note (MPN) for any federal loans.Disclosure statements from your lender.Borrower Rights and Responsibilities statements.Be sure to pay down any consumer debts before you matriculate.Consumer debt cannot be included in your cost of attendance for dental school, thus, you cannot get financial aid to cover these expenses.You may face significant challenges with your budget if you carry consumer debts into dental school.You might be interested in...Financing optionsIn general, there are two types of financial aid for dental students: gift assistance (grants and scholarships) and student loans.  New Student and Family OrientationEverything you need to know about New Student and Family OrientationAugust 3, 2023August 4, 2023byPeople of PacificSchoolHey, Tigers!

However, you must have pre-requisites completed ten weeks prior to the start of class.Back to topDo all prerequisites have to be completed within a specific time frame?No, but it is desired that all prerequisite courses (in particular, the human anatomy and human physiology prerequisites) have been completed within the past seven years of your application date.Back to topCan the prerequisite communication courses be substituted?No, these are requirements set by the Board of Registered Nursing and are verified when ELMSN graduates submit their documentation for licensing exam eligibility. Only courses titled Group Communication, Verbal Communication, Written Communication or closely related titles will be accepted. It is not enough for a course to have an “extensive writing or communication component” or be too specific in one form of writing. All applicants, regardless of their academic or professional background, must complete each of the prerequisites to be considered for admission to the program.Back to topCan one course satisfy multiple prerequisites?No, each course may only satisfy one prerequisite.Back to topHow can an applicant fulfill the Human Development Across the Lifespan course requirement?The course may be offered through a human development or psychology department but must touch upon human development from birth until death. This course requirement can be fulfilled by a series of courses which combined are worth at least three semester units.Back to topIs there a certain grade requirement for the prerequisite courses?Yes, applicants must receive a cumulative GPA of3.2or better in all prerequisite coursework. It is best practice to have a B or better in all nursing prerequisites.Back to topCan prerequisites be waived?No, applicants must complete all prerequisites, regardless of their prior academic or professional backgrounds.Back to topIs AP Credit Accepted?No, we do not accept AP credit in place for prerequisite coursework.GeneralWhat degree will I earn?Master of Science in Nursing (MSN).Back to topHow long is the program?Full time for 24 months and 90 units (six consecutive semesters).

Applicants must submit their applications approximately eight months in advance.Back to topCan I apply if I want to be a family nurse practitioner but I am not a registered nurse?Prospective students first need to be a registered nurse before applying to a family nurse practitioner program. One option is to complete a Master’s Entry Program in Nursing. Graduates are eligible to apply to a Post-MSN family nurse practitioner certificate program upon licensure or apply to a DNP FNP program.Back to topDoes the ELMSN prepare students to become a licensed registered nurse?Yes, the program provides California Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) approved coursework and clinical experiences needed in preparation for the National Council Licensing Examination (NCLEX) to practice as a registered nurse. Upon completion of the entire ELMSN program, students are eligible to take the NCLEX exam to become licensed registered nurses.Back to topWhat is the difference between the Bachelor of Science in Nursing and the Master’s Entry Program in Nursing (ELMSN)?The Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree is an undergraduate program that allows students to complete a bachelor’s degree as they prepare to become registered nurses. The ELMSN is a graduate program designed for individuals who already earned a bachelor’s degree in a different field and seek to transition into clinical nursing and leadership roles.Back to topWhat is the difference between MSN and ELMSN?Both programs are graduate nursing programs, however, MSN is designed for students who already earned bachelor’s degrees in Nursing and seek to further their nursing education. ELMSN is designed for individuals with a bachelor’s degree in another discipline who seek to transition into nursing.Back to topHow is ELMSN program unique?The curriculum incorporates the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (2021) New Educational Standards (Domains). As healthcare is shifting to a community-based model, students will complete coursework in epidemiology, population health, advanced pharmacology and a Public Health Certificate coursework. In addition, the program curriculum was based on best practices as identified through nursing education research. Some of the highlights of this approach are case-based, problem-based learning, and simulation. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, ELMSN graduates are in the highest demand of all nursing programs and earn the highest salaries upon graduation. Also, California employment data (2019) of nursing graduates demonstrated a preference by employers for the ELMSN graduates.Pacific NewsroomEglets give historic gift to Pacific’s McGeorge School of LawOct 12, 2021Share on LinkedInShare on TwitterFacebookTracy and Robert Eglet are giving Pacific's McGeorge School of Law one of the largest gifts in the history of U.S. legal education. Photo by Ashley Golledge.Robert T. Eglet, one of the nation’s top trial lawyers and a 1988 graduate of the McGeorge School of Law, and his law partner and wife, renowned legal negotiator Tracy A. Eglet, are giving University of the Pacific’s law school one of the largest gifts in the history of U.S. legal education, the school announced today.The gift, which will be paid out over time, includes $5 million in support of the school’s advocacy center and another $20 million for scholarships dedicated to first-generation students and students of color. The gift is among the top 15 given to a U.S. law school, the third largest to a California law school and the second largest in the 170-year history of California’s first university.“My wife and I both strongly believe that it is important to give back when you can,” Eglet said. “We are excited that we have the ability to help students who would not otherwise be able to afford law school. We both relied upon assistance throughout law school.”McGeorge's award-winning advocacy program will be renamed theEglet Center for Advocacy and Dispute Resolution. The gift will create three new endowed faculty chairs for the center and a fund that will cover competition fees and travel costs for every qualified team interested in competing as a member of one of McGeorge’smock trial,moot court, negotiations or other competition teams.“I am so proud of the nationally ranked mock trial program at McGeorge,” Eglet said. “I have seen the students in action as they prepared for upcoming competitions, and I was really impressed. Trial law is my passion, and I want to do something that will enhance McGeorge's mock trial program.”The law school’s highly ranked competitions programs provide opportunities for students to improve their trial and appellate advocacy skills and refine their talents in client counseling, negotiations, and arbitration. In the past three years alone, a McGeorge student won the national Top Gun competition for the 16 top student trial lawyers; McGeorge tied for seventh in the country in the American Bar Association Competitions Championship; McGeorge’s negotiations team won the national and international ABA competitions; and McGeorge moot court students won 13 best advocate awards and six best brief awards.U.S. News & World Reportranks McGeorge No. 8 nationallyin trial advocacy.“I want to motivate McGeorge students to go into civil trial practice,” Eglet said. “If I can inspire even one student here to passionately pursue a career in civil trial practice, then I will have achieved my goal.”“This extraordinarily generous gift will change the lives of McGeorge students for generations to come” —President Christopher CallahanThe Las Vegas-based attorney, who heads the trial team atEglet Adams, is one of the nation’s most successful trial attorneys. Eglet has earned his clients more than $1.5 billion in verdicts and settlements in the past 10 years alone. He has served as lead trial counsel in more than 130 civil jury trials with only four losses.Eglet is a recipient of the Thurgood Marshall Fighting for Justice Award for his tenacious effort against overwhelming odds and in achieving success in the fight for justice. He has been named one of the Top 100 Trial Lawyers in the United States by the National Trial Lawyers Association for 12 consecutive years and is a member of the Round Table, the 100 Most Influential Trial Lawyers in America. He was named National Lawyer of the Year in 2010 and National Trial Lawyer of the Year in 2013. He is a recipient of the National Law Journal’s “Keith Givens Visionary Award” for his work in achieving an $800 million settlement in the One October, 2017, MGM mass shooting case and is the only lawyer to be named Nevada Trial Lawyer of the Year twice.  In 2018, Eglet was invited to become a member of “The Inner Circle of Advocates”, an invitation only group of the 100 best plaintiff trial lawyers in the United States.  Eglet is currently the president of the National Trial Lawyers.Tracy A. Egletis also a founding partner of Eglet Adams in Las Vegas. She started her law career in 1993 in Ohio, then moved to Las Vegas in 1996 where she focused on injured persons in the areas of product defect and general negligence. Mrs. Eglet is regarded as one of the top negotiators in the Nevada legal community.  She has been honored as one of The Top 100 Trial Lawyers by the National Trial Lawyers Association and is a longstanding member of the Multi-Million Dollar Advocates Forum. Mrs. Eglet has settled hundreds of millions of dollars in catastrophic injury lawsuits, managed and mediated thousands of cases, and selected multiple juries that have returned verdicts in excess of $50 million.Pacific President Christopher Callahan called the gift “transformational” for the McGeorge School of Law. “This extraordinarily generous gift will change the lives of McGeorge students for generations to come,” Callahan said. “Robert and Tracy are amazing role models for all of us as they show the power philanthropy has to change the trajectory of the lives of students who are dedicating themselves to careers in the law.”The president applaudedDean Michael Hunter Schwartz, who worked closely with the Eglets to design the historic gift. He called the dean, who was named three times to National Jurist Magazine’s list of Most Influential People in Legal Education, a “truly visionary leader.”“Dean Schwartz has dramatically transformed the McGeorge School in just four years at the helm,” Callahan said, pointing to unprecedented successes that include the law school’s highest California bar exam pass rate in 25 years, four consecutive years of improving credentials for incoming students and the best job placement rate in the school’s history. “He is a remarkable leader.”Schwartz, who attributed McGeorge’s recent success to the school’s faculty and staff, called the Eglets “inspiring.”“I love listening to them talk about their cases. They have so much heart for righting societal wrongs, for curbing abusive practices, and for helping others,” Schwartz said. “The reason they have been successful and are able to make this extraordinary gift is because they relentlessly pursue justice.”Schwartz put the gift into context. “The new need-based scholarships will help us address a systemic barrier to diversifying the law school and the profession, and the advocacy center fund will help cement the institution as a leader in trial advocacy, moot court, and legal education,” Schwartz said.The Eglet gift is the largest donation in the law school’s 97-year history. McGeorge will receive an additional $5 million in matching funds from Pacific’s Powell initiative.AlumniDevelopmentMcGeorge School of LawUniversity NewsRelated NewsA Million Miles Away - Now Streaming on Amazon PrimeRead MoreTigers of all generations celebrate at record-setting HomecomingRead MoreTen things to know ahead of Homecoming and Family WeekendRead MoreView AllStockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Master of Science in LawFinancial AidTuition and FeesCome Meet UsThe Sacramento Legal Employers Diversity Collective, in coordination with the University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law, is a long-term, collaborative effort with local elementary, middle and high schools, community colleges and colleges. The legal employers are committed to addressing the need for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the legal profession and building more inclusive pathways to law school. The Collective is a group of 37 of the largest legal employers in Sacramento, with a mix of local, national, and international law firms; state agencies; and public defender and district attorney offices.Members of the Sacramento Legal Employers Diversity Collective are engaging in a four-pronged approach to remedying the lack of diversity across the continuum of legal employment. The Collective prongs are:Pathways Program —There cannot be a more diverse legal workforce if people from historically underrepresented communities do not think they can pursue a career in the legal profession. McGeorge’s Pathways Program brings middle and high school students to McGeorge’s campus and sends attorneys to middle and high schools to talk about the legal profession careers in law. The Collective is working to expand the number of schools and students that this program reaches.Mentoring —Many legal employers have mentoring programs for new attorneys within their organizations. The Collective will work with employers and affinity bar groups to help pair diverse attorneys with mentors at a different employer and, ideally, from similar backgrounds.Recruitment and Retention —Attorneys from diverse backgrounds historically have higher attrition rates in legal careers than white attorneys. The Collective is working to break down silos between employers and give them a constructive space to share information on what is and is not working when it comes to recruiting and retaining a diverse legal workforce. Once the Collective has developed best practices, it will conduct trainings and hold events to help employers implement the best practices.DEI Skills Identification —The Collective will survey employers for the diversity, equity, and inclusion skills they want to see in new hires. Using that data, McGeorge will retool its curriculum to ensure students graduate with those skills.DEI Skills Identification Subcommittee MembersAssociate Dean Mary-Beth Moylan; McGeorge School of Law (Lead)Deepi Miller; Greenberg TraurigKarin Bailey; Kronick, Moskovitz, Tiedemann, & GirardKathren Davis; Seyfarth Shaw LLPKayla Cox; LittlerLissa Oshei; Boutin Jones Inc.Maureen Cooper; Downey Brand LLPMike Daponde; Daponde Simpson Rowe PCNatalie Vance; Klinedinst PCSophia Kwan; Seyfarth Shaw LLPMentoring Committee MembersDean Michael Hunter Schwartz; McGeorge School of Law (Lead)Cecilia Martin; Kronick, Moskovitz, Tiedemann & GirardDouglas Reopel; LittlerJen Shaw; Shaw Law GroupJim Dyer; BuchalterKathren Davis; Seyfarth Shaw LLPLance Olson; Olson RemchoMichelle Chester; Somach, Simmons, & DunnSimerdip Khangura; LittlerSophia Kwan; Seyfarth Shaw LLPThien Ho; Sacramento County District Attorney’s OfficeWiemond Wu; Downey BrandPathways Project Subcommittee MembersSenior Assistant Dean Valerie James; McGeorge School of Law (Lead)Alden Parker; Fisher Phillips LLPAndy Hitchings; Somach, Simmons, & DunnAngelica Maldonado; California Victims of Crime Resource CenterBryan Phipps; Murphy Austin Adams SchoenfeldCarrie Bonnington; Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLPCecilia Martin; Kronick, Moskovitz, Tiedemann & GirardDean Michael Hunter Schwartz; McGeorge School of LawJeffery C.

The 2019 Homeless Point in Time for Sacramento County found that 5,570 persons experience homelessness on a given night, and that number has increased with COVID-19. In 2020, more than 95 homeless men and women died in Sacramento County, and the number of homeless deaths is surging. The data from a variety of governmental and nonprofit organizations is overwhelming that the vulnerable reentry and homeless population suffer disproportionately from serious mental illness and substance use disorders.The HAC established a medical legal partnership with WellSpace Health, a community health center in Sacramento. Medical-legal partnerships with direct legal representation are a proven model to address unmet social determinants of health that impact on homelessness and recidivism. Other current community partners include the Office of the Federal Defender, the Sacramento County Public Defender, and the Exodus Project, an interfaith nonprofit providing mentorship and other services to returning citizens from the Sacramento County jails.Students in the Homeless Advocacy Clinic provide legal services to help eliminate barriers to housing and employment for criminal justice-involved individuals who are experiencing homelessness. Priority legal services include access to public benefits; expungement of criminal records; reduction of traffic fines and fees; child support modification; and credit counseling.Structure of the Homeless Advocacy Clinic and Limit on EnrollmentThis is a one-semester clinic, offered in both fall and spring, for three graded units, which includes a 90-minute weekly seminar. Students are required to engage in 120 hours of client representation and counseling.Students are encouraged to enroll for two semesters to fulfill their experiential learning requirement, to gain additional skills, and to work on cases with more complexity.The Clinic is located in the McGeorge Community Legal Services building at 2925 34th St., Sacramento, CA 95817, on the campus of McGeorge School of Law.Enrollment in the Homeless Advocacy Clinic is limited to 12 students. Priority is given to graduating students.Prerequisites for EnrollmentA written application is required.

During his first on-campus visit, Joshua metCary Bricker, the Co-Director of McGeorge’sEglet Center for Advocacy and Dispute Resolutionand Noël M. Ferris Professor of Trial Skills.White still recalls what she told him. “We are going to make you into an amazing attorney!” she said. Bricker observed that at the end of that very first conversation with Joshua, she knew he would be a spectacular trial lawyer who would give voice to indigent clients and make a real difference in the world, all of which are now proving true.White, who had more than a dozen employment offers right out of law school, believes Bricker delivered on her promise. And he was thrilled that, out of a pool of roughly 1,000 applicants, he received one of four job offers to work at the New York County Defender Services in Manhattan, New York, which was his dream job.As a trial attorney, White serves indigent clients in both misdemeanor and felony cases. He represents his clients at all stages of the criminal process, from arraignment to sentencing, and any time a case goes to trial. White is also the lead attorney on a team that considers each client’s holistic needs, which sometimes requires help from the office’s social workers, investigation team, immigration or housing attorneys.White credits his education at McGeorge School of Law for how well-equipped he was to take on these responsibilities.“I felt really prepared when I started my job. I did not feel nervous going to court for the first time,” White said.White was a stand-out on the law school’s award-winningmock trial team, where students act as trial counsel through all stages of litigation, including pretrial motions, opening and closing statements, direct and cross examinations. In fact, as White was interviewing for jobs, many potential employers asked him to deliver a closing argument, cross-examine a witness, or prepare a motion in limine — all skills that he honed in mock trial.By the time White graduated, he had also represented actual clients through McGeorge’s year-longFederal Defender Clinic. Under the supervision of Assistant Federal DefendersLinda HarterandRachelle Barbour, who co-teach the clinic along with Adjunct ProfessorTimothy Zindel, students are assigned to represent persons charged with misdemeanor crimes occurring under federal jurisdiction such as on military bases and in U.S. parks and the National Forests in the Eastern District of California.“Students handle all aspects of the cases from initial appearance and client interviews through motions, plea, trial, and sentencing. Students in the clinic have conducted complicated evidentiary hearings as well as jury trials,” Zindel said. “It is the best possible introduction to working as a public defender because it is not a simulation. Students represent real people with real cases.”Throughout his time at McGeorge School of Law, White had opportunities to form meaningful relationships with mentors who have impacted his career. He recalls regularly attending McGeorge’s various alumni networking events. Further, White’s position as president of theBlack Law Student Association (BLSA)gave him opportunities to reach out to alumni himself.McGeorge’s location in Sacramento also enabled him to meet legislators in the halls of the State Capitol building. One such legislator was former Assemblymember, now Secretary of State, Dr. Shirley Weber. On his desk, White still has the certificate that she gave to him, in recognition for his work with BLSA.White advises future attorneys to not get overwhelmed or discouraged.“If this is the work that you want to do that you are inspired to do, there is a place for you,” he said.McGeorge School of LawRelated NewsMcGeorge School of Law's moot court program ranked No. 14 in the nationRead MorePacific bookstores amping up selection and serviceRead MoreMcGeorge School of Law community mourns the passing of alumnus who dedicated career to recovering Jewish artwork stolen.

Engineering and technology are integral parts of many careers and fields of study. As "technology" has become so prevalent in our lives and careers, more and more companies are demanding that their employees have working knowledge in such areas as design, graphics, communications, hardware and software advances, etc. Consequently, college students majoring in non-technical disciplines would be well advised to consider taking advantage of technology-related courses to bolster their knowledge and awareness in any of these areas. In order to provide a structure and formal recognition towards this end, Pacific offers a Minor in Technology.The Technology Minor provides an introduction to various aspects of engineering and technology which will strengthen a student's employment qualifications. The University offers a number of engineering and technology-related courses which are basic enough in their content that non-engineering students can enjoy enrollment without intimidation. Phrases like "The Age of Technology" and "Information era" reflect the demand for professionals with more knowledge about engineering and technology. The student who takes advantage of this structured approach to additional studies will likely enjoy much greater job and salary recognition upon college graduation.For more information, contact Dr Gary Martin 209.946.3064 or visit him on campus in the Chambers Technology Center (CTC) 104 with any questions.Minor in Technology RequirementsStudent must not be majoring in engineering.Student must complete a program, approved by the minor advisor, consisting of a minimum of twenty units with a minimum of five courses from the attached list. A minimum of twelve units must be taken at Pacific.Courses that count toward a minor cannot be taken on a "pass/no credit" basis.Students must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.0 in a minor program.Course requirements includeA minimum of three courses from the School of Engineering & Computer Science (i.e., CIVL, ECPE, EMGT, ENGR, or MECH department prefixes), adding up to a minimum of eight units.  (It is strongly recommended that students take ENGR 10 as one of these three classes. This course is intended for the freshman year.)Explore the Technology MinorTechnological Innovation and Entrepreneurship MinorThe Minor in Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship is designed to develop entrepreneurial mindsets and prepare students for the modern multi-disciplinary workplace. Existing and new businesses are increasingly based on new products, processes and services derived from the realms of engineering and science. These organizations are unique in their time frame, level of uncertainty and risk, management, and often in the investment of time and resources required for success. Our students need to be able to integrate the unique needs of scientific and engineering research with business, to learn what business and technical functions bring to the table, and to gain skills in communicating the potential of research and development based innovations and start-ups in both verbal and written form. The interdisciplinary Minor in Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship is open to students of all majors.Minor in Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship RequirementsIn order to earn a minor in Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship, students must complete a minimum of 20 units with a Pacific minor grade point average of 2.0.EMGT 142 — Design and Innovation (4)ENGR 150 — Engineering and Science-Based Entrepreneurship (4)Select 12 units of the followingBENG 108 — Engineering PhysiologyBENG 195 — Senior ProjectCIVL 015 — Civil Engineering GraphicsCIVL 173 — Sustainable EngineeringCIVL 180 — Engineering SynthesisCOMP 127 — Web ApplicationsCOMP 129 — Software EngineeringCOMP 135 — Human-Computer Interface DesignCOMP 155 — Computer SimulationCOMP 159 — Computer Game TechnologiesCOMP 195 — CS Senior ProjectECPE 172 — MicrocontrollersECPE 174 — Advanced Digital DesignECPE 195 — Senior Project IECPE 196 — Senior Project IIEMGT 170 — Project Decision MakingEMGT 174 — Engineering Project ManagementEMGT 195 — Engineering Management SynthesisMECH 015 — Mechanical Engineering GraphicsMECH 100 — Manufacturing ProcessesMECH 140 — Engineering Design/Senior Project IMECH 141 — Engineering Design/Senior Project IIFor more information about the minor in Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship, please contact Program Director,Dr. Mehdi Khazaeliatmkhazaeli@pacific.eduor 209.946.3074.Explore the Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship MinorStockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave. Engineering and Computer Science Student ExperienceStudent OrganizationsSchool of Engineering and Computer ScienceUndergraduateBioengineeringCivil EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer ScienceElectrical EngineeringEngineering ManagementEngineering PhysicsMechanical EngineeringMinorsGraduateComputer Science, MSData Science, MSEngineering, MSCybersecurity, Online MSResourcesCooperative Education ProgramDiversity, Equity and InclusionMESA Schools ProgramMESA University ProgramStudent OrganizationsTransferring to SOECSDirectoryPIESConnectwith others who share your interests!Association of Engineering Students (AES)AES is an umbrella organization for the Engineering clubs, and other non-associated students who are interested in club events.

Pacific is willing to provide you with academic advising while you are still at the community college.You must complete Calculus I firstand then you may contact us to arrange an appointment with a faculty advisor for your respective major. For more information, contact:Michael Doherty Associate Dean, School of Engineering and Computer ScienceHow soon can you transfer?Community college students can transfer to the School of Engineering and Computer Science at any point in their academic program. Most state colleges require that community college students complete their entire freshman and sophomore curriculum prior to transferring to the four-year universities. This is not true at Pacific. If you do not have a least 15 units of college credit, then Pacific will also require the SAT or ACT and will heavily consider your high school academic records as well. The stronger your grades and the harder your courses, the sooner you could be admitted to Pacific.English 1AMost colleges have a basic writing course called, "English 1A" or something very similar. If your writing skills are very strong, you will not be required to take a course like this at Pacific (you will be given a reading and a writing test to determine whether you have passed Pacific's Fundamental Skills Requirement in reading and writing). But it is a good course anyhow, so you may want to consider taking it at your current college, thereby exempting yourself from any possibility of having to take it once you get to Pacific. Master of Science in Law - MSLOnline Master of Science in Law, BusinessMcGeorge Master of Science in LawDiscover Master of Science in LawApplicationCosts and AidCurriculumFrequently Asked QuestionsProgramsConcentration in BusinessConcentration in Government Law & PolicyConcentration in HealthConcentration in Human ResourcesConcentration in Water & Environmental LawBecome a legal-savvy professionalWith University of the Pacific’s all online master’s degree in business law, you’ll gain the skills and knowledge you need to navigate complex legal challenges facing modern workplaces and get ahead in your career no matter your field.

Individual topics that include a specific group of reading assignments, lectures, discussion, and exercises are called modules. Most courses will release new modules each Monday and allow one week for completion.Within the weekly modules, most McGeorge online courses will be primarily asynchronous.

Every fall and spring, McGeorge invites legal employers to campus to interview 2D/3E and 3D/4E students for summer and post-graduation jobs.McGeorge's OCI program is a unique hybrid of private and public employers of all sizes. Our OCI employers have a wide variety of GPA and class rank requirements, thereby allowing all of our students the opportunity to participate.Our program consists of the traditional OCI format, where law firms come to the McGeorge campus to interview students who have certain qualifications. It is also comprised of employers from a wide range of legal sectors that do not necessarily have class rank or GPA requirements. These sectors include JAG, government agencies, DA/PD offices, small- and mid-sized general practice law firms, and boutique firms focused on particular practice areas such as intellectual property, land use, and water law. We draw employers from the local Sacramento area, the entire Central Valley, and throughout California and Nevada.Registration for McGeorge’s Virtual Fall On-Campus Interviews 2023 program begins March 29, 2023 on Symplicity. (Interviews will be virtual on the Flo Recruit platform.)Fall OCI 2023 Employer Session 1 — Interview Dates: Aug. 29, 30 & 31Fall OCI 2023 Employer Session 2 — Interview Dates: Sept. 5, 6 & 7How to Participate | StudentsHow to Participate | EmployersWhat is OCI?On-Campus Interviews (OCI) is a program that brings legal employer to our campus every fall and spring to interview 2D/3E and 3D/4E students for summer and post-graduate position. Fall interviews take place in August and September, but you'll submit applications well in advance — beginning in June. Spring interviews take place in February and March, and employers will interview 1D/2E, 2D/3E and 3D/4E students for summer and post-graduate positions.What is the timing of OCI?Fall OCI is comprised of three weekly deadlines which correspond to groups of employers interviewing during the same week. Different employers participate in each week, or "group" of OCI. While there are three group deadlines, the vast majority of employers participate in the first week of OCI, so you should not put off bidding on interviews.What are my chances of getting a job through OCI?Typically, a small percentage of students receive job offers through OCI. However, this is still one of the best ways to get your resume in the hands of an employer, and we therefore encourage everyone to participate. You could be one of the students who get a job!I heard a rumor that OCI is only for the top of the class. Is that true?While some employers specify a class rank requirement, most OCI employers don't. Many employers are focusing less on grades and class rank, and more on practical experience and other factors. The bottom line is that everyone should apply through OCI!Why should I participate in OCI?Why not?! This is one of the easiest ways to get your resume and cover letter in the hands of an employer. While we can't guarantee that you will be selected for an interview, we can certainly guarantee that if you don't apply, you won't be selected. OCI is a great opportunity and every student should plan to take advantage of this program. As a side benefit, participating in Fall OCI will force you to get your resume, cover letter, and other application materials polished and ready to go early in the academic year so that you are ready to act on any other job postings that come up throughout the year, whether through MCO or otherwise.What types of employers participate in OCI?Fall OCI employers are primarily medium-to-large private law firms and government agencies. Spring OCI tends to have a higher percentage of small firms or employers. There may be a handful of public interest positions available through OCI, but typically OCI does not have a large selection of public interest employers.Does it matter if I upload my application materials first or last?In a word, no. Employers do not have access to your recruiting materials until the day following the deadline, and they have no way of knowing when students uploaded their materials. However, we recommend that you submit your OCI materials in advance (and after they've been vetted by a career advisor) to save yourself the stress of putting everything together at the last minute and running the risk of making a mistake. Also, do NOT wait until 11:40 p.m. on the OCI bid date to start uploading — there are often delays and you may miss the deadline altogether. Good luck!What if I don't get a job through Fall OCI?Don't despair. OCI is just one of many ways that law students find jobs. Most jobs are obtained through other techniques, such as networking and responding to McGeorgeCareersOnline (MCO) job postings. Even if you do participate in OCI, we recommend that you plan a concurrent non-OCI job search. Also, don't forget that there is Spring OCI. While a bit smaller than Fall OCI, Spring OCI tends to draw a different selection of employers comes to campus. We recommend that you plan on submitting bids in both Fall and Spring OCI, while continuing to focus effort on your non-OCI job search.What can I do now to prepare for OCI?In the upcoming weeks, we will send you more information about preparing for OCI. As a starting point, you will need to update your profile on MCO as this is how you will submit OCI bids. You should also update your resume and cover letter and plan to have them reviewed. You will also need to start thinking about compiling a list of references, polishing a writing sample, and tracking down appropriate transcripts. We recommend that you and make sure you have a solid writing sample and list of references by the end of the summer.It is also very important that you routinely check your email for updates, tips and information relating to OCI. We will be providing you with a lot of useful information so that you are ready to submit your bids before the first deadline.Why don't I see very many Fall OCI employers listed?When you view the OCI employers on MCO you will only see those employers that are recruiting for your class year. Fall OCI offers many more opportunities for 2L students than 3L students, because most Fall OCI employers are recruiting summer law clerks, and not new associates. But please don't be discouraged! Keep in mind that most law students ultimately work for small to mid-size law firms and government agencies, and those employers typically don't know their hiring needs this far in advance. Most McGeorge students get their jobs through MCO job postings and referrals, though OCI will lead to jobs for a number of you. If you don't see the types of employers you're interested in participating through OCI, meet with a career advisor to design or update your job search strategy—there are many ways to map out the path to your desired job!Employer and Student Perspectives on OCI (video)Hear employer and student perspectives on why you should participate in the OCI process in this video. Utilizing a wide variety of resources and services, we support our students and graduates as they transition to practice and join the ranks of our 13,000+ strong alumni network.McGeorge reports employment data about its graduates to a number of legal organizations, including the American Bar Association (ABA) and the National Association for Law Placement (NALP). The data reported to the ABA and NALP is used byUS News & World Report. These organizations utilize different methodologies, categories, and definitions when they collect and report on employment data. These variations may cause slight differences in their employment reports. The employment outcomes noted below are published in accordance with ABA Accreditation Standard 509.

ProfessorStocktonEmail Addressdgillette@pacific.eduPhone Number209.932.7611David Gillette, PT, DPT, GCS earned a bachelor of arts in history and a doctor of physical therapy (DPT) from University of Washington. In 2012, he completed a geriatric physical therapy residency at University of Minnesota. He is a certified Geriatric Clinical Specialist.Before pursuing a career in physical therapy, he served in the U.S. Navy. During his time in the Navy he was stationed in Orlando, Florida, Idaho Falls, Idaho and Norfolk, Virginia. Prior to earning his DPT he worked for five years at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.Dr. Gillette is a member of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) and is actively involved in the orthopaedics and education sections, as well as the Academy of Geriatric Physical Therapy. Since 2014, he has been an APTA credentialed clinical instructor.In his role as a faculty member, Dr. Gillette's goal is to help students become outstanding physical therapists and exemplary professionals. He is pursuing his research interests in geriatrics and education.He and his wife have two sons. Together they enjoy hiking, fishing and participating in Cub Scout activities as a family. Dr. Gillette is also an avid photographer.EducationBA in History, University of Washington, 2001DPT, University of Washington, 2009Residency in Geriatric Physical Therapy, University of Minnesota, 2012Teaching InterestsWhen I taught radiation safety to professionals, I intuitively applied Bloom’s taxonomy, albeit roughly.  In the decades since, I’ve learned and grown in my understanding of cognitive, psychomotor, and affective learning.  My courses involve each of these to varying degrees and depth based on the course content and where the course is in the sequence of the curriculum.  I've learned from professors and clinical instructors that there are many ways to facilitate learning. One could ask questions to elicit critical thinking and application, as well as encouraging questions from the student. These questions generally do not exist in a vacuum, but rather are saturated in dialog between the student and teacher. For students who are struggling, sometimes teaching involves encouragement or exhortation while taking into account the students' preferred learning styles. To challenge critical thinking and clinical reasoning, not only is experience vital, but also the encouragement of reflection.I value moving from sage to guide during their two years in the program, evidence-based practice both in my teaching as well as of my teaching, a growth mindset for students and myself, and being student-centered through that.  I believe teaching not just facts or techniques, but also why it is important and how to apply it with increasing complexity.  I believe not just teaching knowledge or techniques, but also professionalism – I strive to model lifelong learning, flexibility, a growth mindset, and empathy. As a teacher, I seek feedback from my students as they provide valuable insight into my role as a teacher and as a physical therapist. I've been able to use this to improve professionally, pedagogically, and personally.I have several goals for my students.  First, I want them to put the patient first.  Second, I want the student and patient to be safe.  Third, I want the student to understand the information provided and demonstrate competency.  My ultimate goal is that I want my students to think critically and clinically.  I don’t want them to just want the answer to a problem such as follow a certain protocol of a certain injury or diagnosis, but be able to think through if the protocol is appropriate and why, and how to apply or modify/adapt it.Research Focus"Education: I'm interested in various aspects of student learning including the development of empathy during the curriculum, as well as the use of technology in the classroom. ""Geriatrics: I'm interested in falls and balance interventions, and the use of technology while working with older adults in the clinic and in the community.""Adherence: I'm interested in how to encourage patients to stick with or perform exercises and how to encourage the community to exercise as a part of their daily lives."Research Interests:Balance and falls interventionsTechnology in the classroom, clinic and communityAdherence to exerciseStockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Campus DirectoryLong WangLong WangChair & PD Nutr, Clin ProfSacramentoEmail Addresslwang3@pacific.eduPhone Number916.325.4666Dr. Wang earned his Ph.D. in Foods and Nutrition from Purdue University and has been teaching in ACEND-accredited nutrition and dietetics programs since 2008.

The ELMSN is a graduate program designed for individuals who already earned a bachelor’s degree in a different field and seek to transition into clinical nursing and leadership roles.Back to topWhat is the difference between MSN and ELMSN?Both programs are graduate nursing programs, however, MSN is designed for students who already earned bachelor’s degrees in Nursing and seek to further their nursing education. ELMSN is designed for individuals with a bachelor’s degree in another discipline who seek to transition into nursing.Back to topHow is ELMSN program unique?The curriculum incorporates the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (2021) New Educational Standards (Domains). As healthcare is shifting to a community-based model, students will complete coursework in epidemiology, population health, advanced pharmacology and a Public Health Certificate coursework. In addition, the program curriculum was based on best practices as identified through nursing education research. Some of the highlights of this approach are case-based, problem-based learning, and simulation. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, ELMSN graduates are in the highest demand of all nursing programs and earn the highest salaries upon graduation. Also, California employment data (2019) of nursing graduates demonstrated a preference by employers for the ELMSN graduates.Back to topApplication informationStudents applying to ELMSN must complete.This program is being phased in over the course of three years, beginning with the class of 2016, students are required to complete (a.) either an Externship or Legal Clinic (3 units minimum), and (b.) a minimum of 8 units of simulation and practicum courses, including at least one simulation course and at least one practicum course.What is a Clinic or Externship?Through the Externship Program and Legal Clinics, students can get hands-on legal experience, putting the theory. They put the theory learned in the classroom into practice in an on-campus or hybrid clinic, or a field placement in a government agency or non-profit setting. Students in the on campus clinics represent real clients under careful supervision and all clinical and field placement students gain real-world legal skills.What is a Simulation Course?Simulation Courses (formerly referred to as Experiential Courses) are courses where students learn by doing, and in which the vast majority of instruction is devoted to professional skills and values required of practicing lawyers. Such courses enable students to integrate legal theory, professional skills, and professional identity.What is a Practicum Course?Practicum Courses are courses in which at least one-third of instruction is devoted to a professional skill or set of professional skills characteristically used by practicing lawyers. Practicum courses give students the opportunity to learn substantive law and also learn and appreciate the context in which that law is to be applied by working on lawyer-like projects on simulated legal matters.How will I know which courses qualify?By their very nature, these courses tend to be dynamic, cutting-edge offerings. From year-to-year the list of qualifying courses will change to reflect legal trends and interesting opportunities for McGeorge students. For example, in Spring 2014, we were able to offer a Practice Skills for Eminent Domain Lawyers simulation class taught by a partner from Downey Brand, in collaboration with the City of Sacramento. Each year, a list of qualifying courses is published online on theOffice of the Registrar page.May I take extra experiential courses?Space permitting, yes. Some students select both a clinic and a field placement and several practicums and simulations! Students report that the courses in the Experiential Curriculum prepare them well for the practice of law.What if I cannot meet the Clinic/Externship Requirement because of my job?Students who work full time (approximately 40 hours/wk) during normal business hours may request a waiver of the Externship/Legal Clinic portion of the Experiential Curriculum. Waiver requests will be reviewed by the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs or the Associate Dean and granted for good cause only.

Please contact our Financial Aid office at 916.739.7158 or finaid@pacific.edu.

You are responsible for confirming your eligibility with the VA. McGeorge is a 100% Yellow Ribbon matching institution.Is it possible for my employer to cover all or part of the tuition?Applicants should check with their individual employers. Of the companies that do assist with tuition payments, some have a limit on the amount of tuition that can be covered in any given year.

Orientation will be available the week before the start of each semester.How are the online courses organized? Are they self-paced?Most courses within McGeorge online graduate programs are offered on a semester-long basis, with weekly modules. Although format may vary depending on the nature of the course, in most courses students should expect to be assigned new topics each week, with associated reading, lecture, discussion, exercises, quizzes, and other interactive activities. Individual topics that include a specific group of reading assignments, lectures, discussion, and exercises are called modules. Most courses will release new modules each Monday and allow one week for completion.Within the weekly modules, most McGeorge online courses will be primarily asynchronous. This means that students do not necessarily need to be online at the same time, and will have the flexibility to complete module activities at a time convenient to their schedules, as long as they complete the activities by the assigned, typically weekly, deadline. Some assignments, such as weekly discussion, may have mid-week deadlines. Some papers or projects may be assigned over several weeks or the course of a semester. To facilitate planning, all deadlines will be announced in the syllabus prior to the beginning of a course.What are the technical requirements for the online programs?Students need to have regular and reliable access to a computer and high-speed Internet. Note that mobile and tablet devices will not provide full access; students will need a laptop or desktop computer with a webcam.Are courses offered during the summer?There will be two units available over the summer. One of these units will have an optional residential requirement. While this is not required, we highly recommend your participation in the option residential opportunity.Is there a residential component?There is no requirement for an online student to come to our Sacramento campus. However, we highly recommend students to participate in the 1-unit hybrid summer course or come to campus for additional learning opportunities.I live in a state outside of California, can I apply?Per the Department of Education, we must be authorized to educate students in any particular state, therefore only students from pre-authorized states may participate in this program.

Most students who attend Pacific receive financial aid.  If you submitted a FAFSA and added University of the Pacific, you were automatically considered for federal grants. If you qualify, they will be listed on your financial aid offer letter.If you haven’t submitted your FAFSA, it’s not too late! Apply atfafsa.ed.gov, and be sure to add Pacific — our school code is 001329. Apply even if you think you won’t qualify — you might be surprised!When you applied to Pacific, you were automatically considered for a merit award, which is similar to a grant in that you don’t have to pay it back. These are based on academic achievement. If you qualify for work-study, it also will be listed on your financial aid offer letter. Work-study jobs not only provide income, but you’ll gain experience and make connections! You can find work-study jobs using Handshake, Pacific’s online job board.You might also consider taking out a student loan, but be sure to research the differences between federal and private loans. Students can qualify for federal loans regardless of income that was listed on the FAFSA and generally have better terms.Once you’ve started attending Pacific, be sure to work with your academic advisor, who will help you plan your degree track so you can finish in the least amount of time possible (and thus pay less for college), if that’s what you desire.For more information about the differences between grants, work-study and loans, and more financial aid resources, visitgo.Pacific.edu/FinancialAid. We hold financial aid webinars for admitted students most Wednesdays through May; be sure to check them out when you’re on the financial aid website!What kind of jobs and internships can help me pay for Pacific?Many students choose to work part-time while attending Pacific. Our Career Resource Center can help you find jobs and paid internships, or you can search for yourself on Handshake, Pacific’s online job and opportunity board. It’s easy and common for students to find work on campus – get your resume drafted up and make an appointment atCareer Servicesto get started!Is the food actually good?Without exaggeration, the food on Pacific’s campus is gourmet. In cooperation with our food service provider, Bon Appetit, we strive to provide healthy, delicious meals for every diet using only the freshest of ingredients. At ourMarketplace, get made-to-order omelets, deli sandwiches, customized pasta and, of course, our famous breakfast burritos and more.

Truck on South Campus offers quick bites for breakfast and lunch. For a late-night bite, head over to The Lair – we recommend the chicken tenders or Impossible Burger!Are the dorms nice?So, you’ll be living on campus and are worried about living in the residence halls. We get it. Pacific has plenty ofhousing options, including Residential Learning Communities (check out ourInstagram Guideon those)! Since you’re a new student, you’ll most likely be living in Grace Covell Hall or The Quad Communities, which both have spacious rooms, communal lounges and well-maintained facilities.You can see more about our residence halls on our Instagram Highlight: Housing.

Our campus provides resources specifically for first-generation students, like First Generation Friday events, support groups atCounseling and Psychological Servicesand student organizations dedicated to cultural and academic support. We also have other academic assistance services, like theStudent Writing Center, free academic tutoring andcareer services. And don’t forget that your faculty advisor is there to make sure you graduate and that you are finding and pursuing your passions, so never hesitate to ask for help!What are the campus vibes?The Pacific campus is notoriously friendly! In fact, it’s nearly impossible to walk across our campus and not see a friend, classmate, professor or staff member you love. Though our faculty and staff on campus are certainly the kindest and most dedicated people you’ll find at any college, Pacific students truly make our campus a community of love and acceptance. You won’t be competing against your classmates; you’ll be working alongside them, supporting each other through some of those tough college courses.

Don't worry. We have compiled a list of frequently asked questions just for that purpose.What is the Powell Match?The Powell Match was established through the transformative $125 million Powell Fund, a gift from the estate of Robert and Jeannette Powell. An astute businessman, Bob Powell appreciated an opportunity to leverage his philanthropy to inspire others, and with this program, he continues to do so. The Powells did not graduate from college themselves, yet served as members of the Pacific Board of Regents for many years and believed deeply in the value of a Pacific education. The Powell Fund matches new endowment gifts to Pacific, up to 1:1. More than $60 million is allocated for endowed scholarship matches and $25 million for endowed academic program matches.What is an endowment?An endowment is a permanent fund at the University established with contributions from donors that will be invested in perpetuity. Each year, a portion of the value of the fund is distributed to support the donor's purpose such as student scholarships or program support. Any earnings in excess of this distribution build the fund's market value. The University's current endowment spending policy is 4.0% of market value. Learn more about endowments.What types of endowments qualify for the match?Endowed funds that provide scholarships or academic support to our faculty and academic programs are eligible for the Powell Match Program. Examples of academic program endowments could include support for a specific department, a faculty position, or student learning opportunities such as academic competitions (e.g., forensics or trial advocacy), a lecture series or experiential learning programs. Examples of scholarship endowments could include gap grants, middle-income scholarships, merit scholarships or study abroad scholarships. From the Powell gift, more than $60 million is allocated for endowed scholarship matches and $25 million for endowed academic program matches.What types and size gifts are eligible for the Powell Match?Gifts of $50,000 or more to establish or enhance an endowment may be eligible to receive a Powell Match. Previously unmatched gifts made after October 1, 2012 may be considered for the match if an additional gift or commitment to the endowment is made. Gifts of cash, stock or other assets, including pledges of up to 5 years in length, qualify for 1:1 matching so long as the assets can be liquidated within a 5-year period.Do I have to make my gift in one payment?It is not necessary to make your gift all in one payment. However, neither the match nor the distribution will occur until the University has received the minimum $50,000. Payment schedules of various lengths may be established by the donor with a maximum duration of five years.How long do I have to fund my endowment?Once a gift and or pledge agreement is signed, the donor has a maximum of five years to reach the minimum required $50,000 to guarantee the Powell Match.Who is eligible for the match?Gifts from individual donors or couples, a group of individuals, family foundations or family owned businesses are all eligible to be matched by the Powell Fund.Can more than one person give to the endowment and be matched?Yes! One or more donors may give to an endowment. Once that endowment reaches the $50,000 minimum, each and every additional gift will be matched on a quarterly basis for as long as matching funds are available.Does my employer's company qualify for the match as well?The Powell Fund will match both your gift and your company's matching contribution. Your company's match can also count toward the $50,000 minimum to qualify for the Powell Match.  So in effect, between the Powell Fund Match and a 1:1 match from your employer, your gift will be quadrupled.Example:$50,000 donor gift + employer match + $100,000 Powell Match = $200,000 endowmentDo planned gifts (deferred gifts) qualify for the match?Planned (deferred) gifts are not eligible for matching.When will the match occur?The match is made available after a gift or payments received toward a pledge total $50,000 or more. Your endowment is established in the quarter that the minimum $50,000 is received. The Powell Match portion is added at the same time.When will a new endowment start being used?If the endowment is funded by June 30, it will have a full distribution (currently at 4%) annually starting the fall after one year of investment. If the endowment has met the minimum after June 30, but prior to Dec. 31, the fund will have a half distribution (2%) starting the following fall and then a full (4%) annual distribution each subsequent year.Gift AmountPowell MatchTotal EndowmentPayment ReceivedDistributionEstimated Amount$50,000$50,000$100,000June 30, 2019Fall 2020$4,000$50,000$50,000$100,000Dec. 31, 2019Fall 2020$2,000Fall 2021$4,000How do I get started?Contact any University of the Pacific gift officer or Tod Davis, Powell Match Manager, at 209.946.2502 ortdavis@pacific.edu.Frequently Asked QuestionsProgram InformationBoth the COVID-19 Relief Scholarship and the CARES Act Emergency Grant programs were created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to assist students.

Any Accelerated Honors Program applicant who is not admitted to that program will be given full consideration for the traditional JD program.Can I enroll in the Accelerated Honors Program after my first year is completed?No. Unfortunately, we have structured the curriculum to start in the spring semester of the Accelerated Honors Students' first year.Am I eligible to participate in study abroad programs as an Accelerated Honors Program student?Participating in a study abroad program is possible if you coordinate and plan accordingly to ensure you are meeting all of the requirements including the honors externship. To stay on track with the accelerated program, you will need to earn externship credits either during the year or in your two other summers. You can fulfill the regular experiential requirement of two capstone experiences over the course of your second and third year, but will need to make up the 7 units from the first summer with a combination of summer coursework or additional units during intersession or during the remaining semesters.Is my tuition covered during my summer honors externship?Yes, you are eligible for seven credit hours of free summer tuition. This can be used for the externship or for summer courses if you opt to study abroad after your first year.What GPA do I need to have to remain in the Accelerated Honors Program and how is it calculated?You must maintain a 3.00 GPA. GPA is calculated the same for AHP and regular JD students. For the first year, GPA is calculated based on the fall and spring semesters. For the second year, GPA is calculated based on any course taken during the summer before the second year and the fall and spring semesters of the second year. AHP students stay with the same entering cohort (of both regular JD and AHP students) throughout their time at McGeorge for GPA calculations and ranking.If your GPA falls below 3.0, you will need to meet with the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs or the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs to discuss your academic planning. If you improve your GPA during your second year and continue your progress towards completion of your JD a semester early, you may still graduate with AHP recognition as long as your final GPA exceeds 3.0. You may also be advised to discontinue the acceleration of your JD pursuit and graduate without the AHP designation.Where do most of your student's extern?Most students in the accelerated honors program will participate in an externship during the first summer after they commence law school. Externships will be full time for 10 weeks, and students will earn seven (7) credits. Example of externship placements include:Trial and Appellate Judges (state and federal)California Attorney General's Office (various divisions)Fair Political Practice CommissionFranchise Tax BoardDistrict Attorney's OfficePublic Defender's OfficeCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency – State Water Resources Control BoardCalifornia Department of Human ResourcesChildren's Law CenterCalifornia Department of Managed Health CareOther externship placements at non-profit and governmental agencies and organizations are also available and each student will be individually placed with consideration given to her or his area of interest.What is the benefit of participating in the Accelerated Honors Program?Accelerated Honors students will obtain their law licenses and be eligible to start practicing while their peers are preparing for the bar exam and therefore will begin working as attorneys or policy makers six months ahead of their peers in traditional three-year full-time programs.Because students in the Accelerated Honors Program participate in a free summer externship as part of the program, students in McGeorge's unique program save thousands of dollars.The most accurate way to compare the cost of attending McGeorge's Accelerated Honors Program is to discount the total cost of attendance by the free summer externship and the six months of income students will earn while their peers are studying for and taking the bar exam and waiting for their results.What is the purpose of the interview requirement?The interview provides an opportunity for both parties to ensure that your participation in this program will provide you all the opportunities for success available. Your application allows us to ascertain certain things about you, but an interview gives us an opportunity to talk with you about your experiences and determine whether the accelerated honors program is likely to be a good fit for you.Can I participate in mock trial, moot court, law review if I am a member of the Accelerated Honors Program?Like all McGeorge students, you will have the opportunity to earn a spot on our competition teams and/or law review. Our teams are nationally recognized and participating in them brings many opportunities to hone your craft and prepare you for your legal career. Because Mock Trial and Moot Court are designed to be year-long experiences, participation in these activities in your third year may be somewhat restricted.What if I start in the Accelerated Honors Program and change my mind?No problem. Depending on when you decide, you will be able to take a lighter load of classes. Once you have elected to drop the AHP program, reentry is not possible.What are the eligibility requirements?Competitive students will have excellent academic credentials and distinctive life experiences to support successful completion of an accelerated JD degree. Students with a 157 LSAT score and a 3.3 or better undergraduate grade point average (UGPA) or a 156 and 3.5 or better UGPA presumptively will qualify for an interview. Students whose entrance credentials do not meet these prerequisites may qualify for an interview if their LSAT score and UGPAs are similar to these requirements and other aspects of their application justify further evaluation of their candidacy for the program.How does the Accelerated Honors Program give me a competitive advantage in the legal employment market?It helps in two ways. First, it puts you in the legal market sooner at a time when many other legal graduates are not job-searching. Second, your designation as an Accelerated Honors graduate is a mark of distinction that is likely to be impressive to future employers.How will potential employers know that I've completed the Accelerated Honors JD Program?As a new program, many employees will likely be unfamiliar with what it required to complete your degree faster than average. Placing this on your resume will undoubtedly open the door for you to discuss the nuances of the program and your ability to perform at such a rigorous academic level. You will also receive a certificate upon graduation and a designation on the commencement program. Will I select my own summer honors externship or will one be assigned to me? McGeorge will provide a list of opportunities, and the Director of Externships will work with you personally to find the best fit for you. We have a wide range of approved externship sites and will be able to find an experience to align with your interests and experiences.If I do not maintain the required GPA for the Accelerated Honors JD Program, how will I be integrated into the traditional JD program?Your integration with the three-year program will be seamless. You will have been taking classes with students in the three-year curriculum all along, and you will continue to do so if you end up in the traditional program.CentersCareersPublicationsFaculty ResourcesAccess to CDHCS's collections is by special appointment only. For more information or to make an appointment, please emailpr@pacific.edu. Our complete policies and information can be found below.FormsApplications are available to students, faculty and other qualified professionals who wish to study the collection.Student Research Request FormFaculty Research Request FormVisiting Scholar Research Request FormPoliciesAccession and Deaccession of Human SkullsThe Atkinson Collection contains over 2400 accessioned human skulls, crania and mandibles. The majority of these individuals were acquired by Dr. Spencer R. Atkinson, an eminent orthodontist and craniofacial researcher, from 1919 to 1963. The University of the Pacific received his private collection in 1963. Subsequent additions have resulted from the dental school's human gross anatomy course during the early 1990s. More recently, a number of dental school alumni have donated skulls that they had purchased from biological supply houses during their dental school days.The Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study (CDHCS) makes every effort to ensure the continued security and preservation of donated skulls. Museum-quality cabinets and archival-quality trays house the Atkinson Collection. Specimens are handled minimally. During research studies involving examination of the skulls, curator assistance is mandatory.Acquisition GuidelinesSkulls donated to CDHCS must be recognizable as originally purchased from a biological supply house (i.e., specimen obviously prepared under laboratory conditions, with tissue removal, degreasing, and bleaching having resulted from standardized preparation techniques) or designated as non-Native American in ethnicity. Subsequent to receipt of a specimen, CDHCS staff may request a 30 day examination period if the specimen's derivation seems questionable.All acquisitions are to be outright and unconditional. Skull donations must be made with the understanding that, while the donor's preference may be taken into consideration, CDHCS staff will determine whether to accession the specimen into the main research collection or into the smaller teaching collection.Federal law prevents CDHCS from providing identification services or appraisal values for donated skulls. Donors are responsible for appraisals of value. Please contact biological supply houses or internet companies specializing in human osteological remains to determine approximate values. CDHCS is in no way affiliated with these organizations.Accession ProcessAccession RecordUpon receipt, the donation will be examined and described for accessioning purposes in an Accession Record. The donor will receive a copy of the Accession Record containing the following:Acquisition information: date received, CDHCS receiver's name, method of delivery of specimen to CDHCS;Donor information: donor's name, address, phone number and email address;Donation information: description of specimen, documentation relating to specimen, accession number and catalogue number(s) assigned;Donor Release statement: "The objects listed above (and/or on attached list), when accepted by Museum Committee, become the sole and permanent property of Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study of the University of the Pacific, Arthur A.

Each skull will be packed by CDHCS personnel in a loaned skull box with appropriate packing materials prior to transport. The skull boxes and packing material should be stored in appropriate facilities for preservation. The researcher will repack loans in the same or similar material. If a CDHCS staff member or outside professional is chosen as the courier, all courier expenses, including airline tickets, lodging, courier fee (for supervising unpacking, mounting, installation, de-installation, and repacking), and any other unforeseen expenditures will be paid by the borrower. At the designated destination, the researcher will make arrangements necessary for storage of the loaned skulls in a secured room prior to and after use.Care/PreservationThe individual researcher will protect loans from mishandling, dirt, insects, fire, theft, and extreme variations in light, temperature and humidity at all times. Loans will be handled only by the researcher and experienced professional assistants. Specimen handling will be kept to a minimum.

Photography by the general public is not allowed. Subjecting objects to any artificial or natural light beyond that agreed upon for display purposes requires separate permission from the CDHCS.Catalogue/Publication/Research FindingsIf a publication accompanies the exhibition or results from research, CDHCS requests two copies for its archives. CDHCS also requests copies of promotional materials that contain its specimens. If published, the specimen caption should include the following credit line: "Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy, University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California" accompanied by the specimen's catalogue number. A report of research findings must be provided to CDHCS at the conclusion of a loan made for research purposes regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.Loan ProcessLoan Approval Letter and Loan AgreementFollowing consideration of the initial loan request by the CDHCS curator, and approval by the museum chairperson and administration representative, the borrower and individual researcher they represent will be notified of the approval, in writing, and provided with an invoice for administrative fees and related costs, if any. An itemized list of specimen insurance values will be included within the letter. Once the borrower has complied with loan agreement conditions, and provided a memorandum and certificate of insurance, the loan agreement will be signed by all parties. Once the loan agreement form is signed, no additions to the specimen list are permitted.Loan FormIn addition to possible formal loan agreement documentation, on the day of the loan the researcher will sign an appropriate loan form that will contain, depending on which type of loan, some portion of the following information: specimen catalogue number(s); value of specimen(s); insuring party; researcher's name, phone number, affiliation and email address; brief description of the purpose of loan; proposed means of transport; anticipated date of return; age of each specimen; loaned condition of each specimen (see Loan Condition Report below); brief summaries of specimen care and handling guidelines, and acknowledgement of conditions governing loans. The loan form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Loan Condition ReportWhen the loan is processed, the CDHCS curator will record the skull condition within the faculty teaching/demonstration loan form, including damaged and/or missing areas of the skull and dentition, and congenital conditions. In signing the loan form, the instructor agrees that the borrowed specimens are received in the recorded condition.Loan Period and Renewal of LoanLoans are generally made for a maximum of six months. Requests for renewal must be made in writing to the curator and received 30 days before the expiration of the loan. The loan will be reviewed by the curator, museum committee, and administration representative if more than two renewal requests are submitted.Return of LoanThe researcher agrees to return the loan only to the CDHCS curator, by the date specified in the signed loan agreement, unless other arrangements are agreed to in advance by CDHCS.Loan FeesLoan Handling FeeResearch and exhibit loans are not subject to the administrative loan handling fee. Commercial use loans are subject to the administrative loan handling fee and will be charged a flat rate of $200 per specimen borrowed. This fee covers the cost of locating specimens, producing a loan condition report, processing forms, and packing, receiving and returning specimens to storage. Additional fees apply to commercial use loans that result in product development and distribution, as indicated in the Production of Images section.Loan Request Cancellation FeeOnce a formal loan request has been received from a non-UOP researcher, and review by CDHCS staff has begun, if the loan request is cancelled, withdrawn or postponed indefinitely by the researcher, a loan request cancellation fee of $50 will be charged to the borrower, whether the loan request was made on behalf of a prospective research project, exhibit or for commercial use. In addition, should the commercial use borrower cancel a loan request after a cost, such as the loan handling fee, has been incurred by CDHCS on behalf of the borrower, the borrower is responsible for that cost.InterpretationIn the event of any conflict between this agreement and any forms of the borrower, the terms of this agreement shall be controlling.Research Access to Skull CollectionsResearch RequestsThe Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy (Atkinson Collection) and P&S Comparative Anatomy collections are open to research by all qualified personnel. Access to the collections is by appointment only. Appointments are scheduled by the CDHCS curator upon receipt of a written statement of research objectives and data collection methods. (See links to research request forms at the top of this page.) All research requests should be emailed toCDHCScurator@pacific.eduon institutional letterhead addressed to:CDHCS CuratorUniversity of the PacificArthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry155 Fifth StreetSan Francisco, CA 94103A report of research findings must be provided to the CDHCS curator at the conclusion of a research study regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.University of the Pacific Faculty and Students, and Visiting ScholarsTo gain research access to the skull collections, please complete the appropriate Research Request application available at this site (see Forms), or request an application form from the CDHCS curator.Research Approval ProcessFor adequate review and scheduling, research requests must be submitted at least three months in advance by visiting scholars and one month in advance by dental school faculty and students. Proposed visit date(s) and study duration will be discussed at the time of research request submission to determine the feasibility of dates and times. Following consideration and approval of the research request by the CDHCS curator, the researcher will be notified of the approval in writing.Research ConditionsResearchersResearch permission is granted only to faculty and students of the University of the Pacific, to visiting scholars affiliated with academic institutions and to medical and dental professionals.Research Use FormOn the day of the visit, the researcher will sign a Research Use Form that contains the following information: Researcher's name, phone number, affiliation or professional address, email address, a brief description of conditions governing research use, and a list of specimens examined. The Research Use Form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Designated Research AreaResearch study of the skull collections by University of the Pacific faculty and students, and by visiting scholars must take place at the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry in the CDHCS's designated research area. Special permission must be obtained to transport specimens to nearby facilities, inside or outside the dental school, for photographing, X-raying or CT scanning.Specimen SelectionTo facilitate the sample selection process, an on-site Atkinson database is now available for use by researchers. Pre-selection of skulls using images and information in the database will minimize the visitor's need to survey the collection itself, an activity CDHCS discourages due to collection preservation concerns. If preferable, based on the objectives of the study and in consultation with the researcher, the CDHCS curator will select a specific or random sample of specimens from the skull collection.Care and PreservationThe curator will do most of the handling of the specimens, retrieving them from the storage cabinets for study and returning them after examination is completed. In this manner the potential for damage to the specimens is minimized. On the first day of the study, the researcher will be asked to read CDHCS's Procedural Advice for Handling Skulls guidelines and to sign a research form. There are no restrictions on the number of specimens available for study.Research FeesCurrently there are no research fees charged to students and faculty, or to visiting scholars.Teaching Access to Skull CollectionsTeaching Requests — Off-Site or On-Site LocationThe P&S Comparative Anatomy Collection and a subset of specimens from the Atkinson Collection are available to University of the Pacific faculty for teaching and class demonstrations located either off-site within the dental school building or on-site in room 410, the CDHCS facility.

Also, filing a report helps the University create a safe and welcoming campus climate that better supports everyone's ability to learn and/or work. If bias-related incidents go unreported, it makes it difficult for the University to appropriately address the issue, it diminishes campus climate, it may make some members of our community feel unsafe or unwelcome, or additional incidents may occur.What happens after a report has been filed?Because Pacific remains deeply committed to promoting and maintaining a civil community and maintaining a community that is respectful of all persons, the University will address all reported incidents that violate the student code of conduct, University policies and/or federal, state and local laws.An individual filing a report should know that once the University has received a report, the following steps typically occur:Confirmation that the report has been received will be communicated within 2 business days (should the individual(s) filing the report choose to include his/her name and contact information).Careful review of the details of the report to ensure that we have accurately understood the nature of the occurrence or violation.Conduct outreach to gather any additional relevant information that may be required in order determine what, if any, conduct, policy or legal violation has occurred:The process may include contacting individuals or groups who may have been involved in the occurrence as a bystander, a reporter or a respondent in order to obtain more information and/or it may include communicating with other appropriate campus officials, departments/offices or organizations.The University reserves the right to review incidents which may have occurred on and off campus when it involves a member of the Pacific community and depending upon the seriousness of the alleged conduct, policy or legal violation.Provide a safe setting for anyone involved in the incident to share information about what has occurred and as needed, make referrals to appropriate campus and community resources including the University's Victim's Advocate Program and the Counseling Center among others:Individuals will have an opportunity to learn what services are available to assist them as well as how to access and utilize those services.Determine an appropriate response to an occurrence, which may require assistance from appropriate campus offices or departments.In the case of students, the office of student conduct may be referred to.Matters involving University employees may be referred to Human Resources.Initiate appropriate outreach and education since the unfortunate occurrence of an incident may create specific educational opportunities for those connected to the incident through additional interventions:It provides the University with an opportunity to restate our commitment to Pacific's principles "that diversity and inclusion are essential to the fulfillment of our institutional mission. We value inclusiveness in learning, curricular and co-curricular programming, campus climate, recruitment, admissions, hiring and retention."Depending upon the nature of the incident and the type of response that is required, key campus officials may initiate meetings with appropriate individuals or affinity groups to offer ongoing support, advocacy and/or updated information.Educating everyone, students, faculty, staff, alumni and our local community, about bias-related matters is important. Further, without breaching anyone's confidentiality or right to privacy, this may be an opportunity to develop curricular and co-curricular experiences that can be offered throughout the academic year that foster the advancement of diversity and inclusion.The Bias Response process is managed through the Senior Director of Culture and Belonging, Rolly Kali-Rai, who may be contacted atrkalirai@pacific.edu.Will the campus community be notified of the outcome?It should be noted that to the extent that federal, state and local law as well as University policies permit, Pacific will keep appropriate individuals and groups apprised of the progress of an investigation and the final outcome on a "need-to-know" basis.To protect the privacy of all the individuals or groups involved, the University may not be able to release some of the details related to the incident; however, a summary report of all bias reporting, outcomes and findings will be used to proactively guide education and prevention efforts to foster culture and belonging.To remain compliant with the Clery Act, reported hate crimes will become a part of the mandatory documentation that is posted regularly with the Office of Public Safety's crime statistics.JD Degree RequirementsAcademic SupportFinancial Aid OfficePre-Law Advising ResourcesInformation for Students from CanadaCareer Development OfficeTuition and FeesABA DisclosuresWhat is the Yellow Ribbon Program?The Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program (Yellow Ribbon Program) is a provision of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008.

Here you will find information about:Cost and Financial AidThe public administration and public policy programs and the McGeorge School of LawCurriculum and RequirementsStudent LifeIf you have a question that isn't answered here,please contact us.Cost and Financial AidAre scholarships available?Each application to the MPA and MPP programs is automatically considered for scholarships. If accepted, the letter of admission will include details about the scholarship assistance McGeorge is able to offer. Most students receive a scholarship. Scholarship amounts are dependent on the strength of the application, the timing of the recruitment cycle, and other factors. For this reason, it is strongly encouraged that prospective applicants submit their application as early as possible to maximize the benefits which are available to them. Additionally, the McGeorge Financial Aid office is available to advise on Federal assistance programs, and other options available to graduate students.How much do the programs cost?Each semester, students pay tuition based on the number of units they are taking. Tuition for the 2023-24 academic year is $1,500 per unit, and students enroll in 4-12 units per semester. Fees for the Wellness Center and student activities range from $140 to $215 per semester. Finally, all students are required to have health insurance. If a student is not already covered under a health insurance plan, they will be required to purchase the student health insurance plan. Total tuition for the 36-unit MPA degree is $54,000 and for the 44-unit MPP degree is $66,000 before accounting for scholarships and other financial aid.

In addition, federal student loans and on-campus work-study jobs are available for qualified students who complete the FAFSA.Can federal loans be forgiven by public service?Some federal loans can be partially forgiven if employed in public service.Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF)Does McGeorge participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program for veterans?McGeorge is proud to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program.Information about Eligibility & BenefitsThe MPA/MPP Programs and the McGeorge School of LawDoes the American Bar Association accredit the MPP or MPA degrees?No, the ABA only accredits the JD degree at any law school, including McGeorge. The American Bar Association approved offering this degree through McGeorge School of Law by granting "acquiescence" In 2015. This allowed the MPA and MPP programs to be offered under the law school as well as allowing JD students to take public policy courses as electives.How does this program fit into law degrees at McGeorge?McGeorge School of Law offers the JD, MSL, LLM, and JSD law-related degrees and two non-law degrees — the MPP and MPA. The public policy and law degrees complement and strengthen each other. You will take at least two law courses among your required courses and more for an area of concentration. Law students may enroll in public policy courses and some students will pursue both a JD and MPP or JD and MPA degree.Is it possible to earn a JD degree as well as a MPP or a MPA?Through McGeorge’s dual-degree program, you can earn both the JD and the MPP or MPA with just one more year of study in addition to that required for the JD, but saving a year compared to pursuing both degrees independently. Admission to the JD program requires a separate application, and admission into the MPA or MPP program does not guarantee admission into the dual-degree program for the JD.McGeorge’s dual-degree programWhat is McGeorge’s Influence in the Community?McGeorge School of Law has been educating lawyers in Sacramento since the 1920s. McGeorge alumni dominate lists of the 100 most influential attorneys in Sacramento and McGeorge alumni are leaders in state agencies, lobbying firms and non-profit organizations as well as law firms in Sacramento and beyond.Members of our McGeorge family serve on nonprofit boards, provide pro-bono legal services, and participate as active community volunteers for dozens of local and national community outreach organizations. Students, faculty, staff and alumni contribute thousands of hours annually to support important community and charitable efforts.Curriculum and RequirementsWhat are classes like?Our courses are typically comprised of 10-25 students. Classes are structured to allow for a working schedule, with most courses being offered in-person during the evenings or on weekends. While a few courses and individual class sessions are on-line, the vast majority of classes are taught in-person on our Sacramento campus.In PUB classes, students engage in spirited policy discussions and learn about innovative management approaches from experienced professionals. Most assignments take the form of recognized professional work products, such as a decision memo, an analysis to be presented to a committee of the California state legislature, an issue brief or comment on a proposed regulation. Some assignments are individual, while others are based on team work.Is a thesis required?No. Our Masters of Public Administration and Masters of Public Policy programs focus on practical professional skills. Instead of writing a thesis (a type of document you are unlikely to replicate later in your career) you'll participate in a capstone course. This capstone course requires students to construct a professional presentation on a major issue of public administration and/or policy by pulling together the knowledge and skills gained from all previous classes.How Should I choose between the MPA and the MPP?Are you most interested in working with others to implement public policies? Do you like partnering with or managing others in direct actions? If so, the MPA, which emphasizes leading and managing competencies, is a good choice. Are you most interested in analyzing how to solve complex public policy issues, including how to identify and assess options for action? Do you like developing policy proposals and then getting them enacted into law or regulation? If so, the MPP which emphasizes analytic and policy making competencies, is a good choice. We would be happy to work with you in figuring out which program is a better fit for your strengths and needs.Student LifeWhy Sacramento?No state and few nations face the complexity and consequence of policy choices made and implemented in California. The campus, located just 10 minutes from the State Capitol, is at the epicenter of the offices of state, federal and local agencies, plus those of non-profits and advocacy firms focused on public policy making and implementation. This proximity ensures that our students are able to analyze, observe and engage in today's most critical issues.Sacramento is also an excellent place to live, work, and play!

In some cases, the undergraduate record is given different weight in relation to more recent employment or graduate work experiences since undergraduate work may have been completed many years ago.

Does this mean I won't get admitted?Grade trends such as this are evaluated often. Many students have uneven year-by-year undergraduate records. Evidence of overall academic strength is more important and, in general, superior performance in recent rigorous academic work is of significance, even if earlier grades were at a lower performance level. A short explanatory addendum to your personal statement is a good place to address such deficiencies.What factors does McGeorge consider when evaluating applications, and how are those factors weighed in the review process?The two largest components that are considered in predicting an applicant's relative success in law school are the grade point average and the LSAT score. Though these are useful predictors, they are not the only factors the admissions committee will consider when reviewing your application. McGeorge reviews each application in its entirety, considering every component. The admissions committee will take into consideration grade trends, leadership, volunteer and work experience, the personal statement, any addenda the applicant submits, and any information included in letters of recommendation. All components assist the admissions committee in determining an applicant’s academic potential and propensity for success in law school.How much is JD tuition?Tuition (subject to Board of Regents approval) for the 2023-2024 academic year is $59,080 for the full-time program and $39,283 for the part-time program.We expect a 3% increase in tuition for the 2024-2025 academic year. Please note that there are additional required fees and summer school is charged on a per unit basis;visit our tuition pagefor more information.How do I find out more about financial aid?For complete information on deadlines, options and the financial aid process, please visit thefinancial aid web page.

Dugoni School of Dentistry?A: No, all IDS applicants (first-time or returning) must submit a CAAPID application directly with the American Dental Education Association (ADEA).Q: I have previously submitted an application directly to the Dugoni School of Dentistry.

It is also important to understand that ADEA may take more than 2 weeks before releasing the CAAPID application to Pacific, so the earlier you can submit your application, the better.Q: I see that I can still submit my CAAPID application to other programs, but I am not able to submit it to the Dugoni School. Is this normal after the application deadline?A: Yes, many programs using the CAAPID application service all have their own deadlines and processes. The Dugoni School of Dentistry has set their deadline for Friday, June 9, 2023, by 11:59 pm Eastern Time, though your CAAPID application will remain active until early February 2024. During this time, you may also submit your CAAPID applications to other programs. Our deadline is final, and no exceptions or extensions will be made.

It is recommended that you replicate the sample CV and classify your dental experience by International and/or United States / Canada.Q: Can I submit updates to my dental CV after my CAAPID application is submitted?A: No, the IDS Admissions office will not be accepting any application updates after the CAAPID application is submitted.

Can I put it on my CV?A: The CV is geared towards getting information on experiences after dental school only (some sections allow items from during dental school). However, you will also be logging experiences directly on your CAAPID application. In the CAAPID experiences section, you may include any experiences gained prior to your dental degree in this area.Q: How many letters of recommendation are required for admission?A: Three letters are required, submitted through your ADEA CAAPID Application. Otherwise known as “Evaluations,” all three letters should be written in English (or translated to English by a certified translator) and should be as recent as possible written, signed, and dated no later than January 2020.Q: Who should I ask to write these letters for me?At least two of these three letters must be written by either U.S. or international dental professionals (dentists, dental school faculty, etc.) with whom you have worked or studied from.

Failure to correct errors in a timely manner can cause your file to be incomplete after the June deadline passes.Q: Do I need to submit letters of evaluation to the Dugoni School of Dentistry when I already submitted them to ADEA CAAPID?A: No, ADEA CAAPID will ask for up to three letters when you are completing your application.

I.e., if you get a lower score when you retake the TOEFL, the Admissions Committee will consider that new score, and the higher first score will be voided.Q: Will you accept TOEFL retakes that are taken after application submission?A: Yes if we receive the TOEFL scores before the June deadline. We will include the new scores for the committee’s review. After the deadline, we will not consider the new TOEFL scores.Dental Diploma/CertificateQ: Can I apply with a medical degree?A: Only applicants who have earned a dental degree (BDS, DDS, DMD, Odontology, Stomatology) are eligible to apply to the IDS program.Q: Can I apply with a provisional dental degree?A: IDS Admissions do not accept provisional dental degrees nor offer any exceptions to this dental degree requirement.
