For the most part, the fact that you have come to CAPS and what you discussed here is confidential and will not be revealed to anyone outside of CAPS. However, there are rare exceptions. For example, if you tell us that a child or someone over the age of 65 is being abused, we have to report that to the appropriate agency. If you tell us that you plan to seriously hurt yourself or someone else, we may have to intervene to ensure everyone's safety. We also sometimes work in conjunction with medical staff at Pacific Health Services and/or with the Student Victim Advocate. These exceptions are detailed in the Informed Consent statement you will be given during your first appointment. Additionally, the therapist you see will answer any further questions you have about exceptions to confidentiality. Is it true that you won't see some students? My friend said you wouldn't give him counseling and told him to see a private therapist. We will meet with any student for an initial assessment. There are circumstances in which the therapist determines that an individual's needs are beyond the scope of the services offered at CAPS. In these instances, we will offer a referral to other sources of help on or off campus."

Yes, both DPD-students and non-DPD students must complete the Pacific MSCN Prerequisite Coursework section in GradCAS. The cumulative GPA of all Pacific MSCN Prerequisite Courses is used as the program’s Admission Requirement and must be 3.00 or higher. Pacific does not offer these courses at this time. You may complete these courses from any accredited college/university. All Pacific MSCN Prerequisite Courses must be completed with official transcripts submitted before the program start date. Students cannot be concurrently finishing up prerequisite courses once the program has started. No. You must complete a food science course. This course is often called Experimental Foods (with lab) or Food Science (with lab) (4 units). This is a good question and often depends on the curriculum of your program – and whether you are completing quarter or semester courses. Different programs also call these courses different names (for example, MNT, human nutrition, advanced nutrition). In general, you can only apply one of your courses completed towards one Pacific MSCN prerequisite course (you can’t list a single course to count as two prerequisites). You will need to carefully review the Course Descriptions and Course Objectives from your Course Catalog or class syllabi to determine which courses address macronutrient and micronutrient metabolism, and your department or major advisor may also be able to offer guidance on which of your courses best fulfill these prerequisites.

    "answer": "The sticker price of attending any college or university can be jarring, but that’s not what you’ll be paying out of pocket. Most students who attend Pacific receive financial aid. If you submitted a FAFSA and added University of the Pacific, you were automatically considered for federal grants. If you qualify, they will be listed on your financial aid offer letter. If you haven’t submitted your FAFSA, it’s not too late! Apply at fafsa.ed.gov, and be sure to add Pacific — our school code is 001329. Apply even if you think you won’t qualify — you might be surprised! When you applied to Pacific, you were automatically considered for a merit award, which is similar to a grant in that you don’t have to pay it back. These are based on academic achievement. If you qualify for work-study, it also will be listed on your financial aid offer letter. Work-study jobs not only provide income, but you’ll gain experience and make connections! You can find work-study jobs using Handshake, Pacific’s online job board. You might also consider taking out a student loan, but be sure to research the differences between federal and private loans. Students can qualify for federal loans regardless of income that was listed on the FAFSA and generally have better terms. Once you’ve started attending Pacific, be sure to work with your academic advisor, who will help you plan your degree track so you can finish in the least amount of time possible (and thus pay less for college), if that’s what you desire. For more information about the differences between grants, work-study, and loans, and more financial aid resources, visit go.Pacific.edu/FinancialAid. We hold financial aid webinars for admitted students most Wednesdays through May; be sure to check them out when you’re on the financial aid website!"

    "answer": "The Pacific campus is notoriously friendly! In fact, it's nearly impossible to walk across our campus and not see a friend, classmate, professor or staff member you love. Though our faculty and staff on campus are certainly the kindest and most dedicated people you'll find at any college, Pacific students truly make our campus a community of love and acceptance. You won't be competing against your classmates; you'll be working alongside them, supporting each other through some of those tough college courses. So, a word of advice: If you don't want to chat with a dozen friendly faces on your way to class, invest in some headphones and a hoodie."
