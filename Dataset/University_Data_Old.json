If you submitted a FAFSA and added University of the Pacific, you were automatically considered for federal grants. If you qualify, they will be listed on your financial aid offer letter.If you haven\u2019t submitted your FAFSA, it\u2019s not too late! Apply at fafsa.ed.gov, and be sure to add Pacific \u2014 our school code is 001329. Apply even if you think you won\u2019t qualify \u2014 you might be surprised!When you applied to Pacific, you were automatically considered for a merit award, which is similar to a grant in that you don\u2019t have to pay it back. These are based on academic achievement.If you qualify for work-study, it also will be listed on your financial aid offer letter. Work-study jobs not only provide income, but you\u2019ll gain experience and make connections! You can find work-study jobs using Handshake, Pacific\u2019s online job board.You might also consider taking out a student loan, but be sure to research the differences between federal and private loans. Students can qualify for federal loans regardless of income that was listed on the FAFSA and generally have better terms.Once you\u2019ve started attending Pacific, be sure to work with your academic advisor, who will help you plan your degree track so you can finish in the least amount of time possible (and thus pay less for college), if that\u2019s what you desire.For more information about the differences between grants, work-study and loans, and more financial aid resources, visit go.Pacific.edu/FinancialAid. We hold financial aid webinars for admitted students most Wednesdays through May; be sure to check them out when you\u2019re on the financial aid website!"

Stockton sits in the Central Valley of California, making it a perfect home for those who don't want to decide between mountains and beaches, cities and nature. Stockton is an inland port with a historic waterfront, so we benefit from the intersection of major freeways, rivers and railroads. Take I-5 all the way up to Portland, Ore., or all the way down to Los Angeles. The Stockton Metropolitan Airport can also get you down to Southern California for as little as $80. We get 257 days of sunshine, temperatures up to 110 degrees in the summer and little humidity. So, bring sunscreen! In the winter you can expect some rainy days and wind, but nothing an umbrella can't handle. Seriously, you're going to love our city."
