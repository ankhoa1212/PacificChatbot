    "# Classification is based on the University Dataset\n",
    "## Problem Statement 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "As the project involves creating a university chatbot, we aim to build a binary classification model to determine whether the text refers to program-related data or general university data. The dataset includes information on various aspects such as Pacific card, housing, dining, and course-related details. We categorize the data into academic and non-academic labels for classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **SVC** demonstrates the highest accuracy (96.44%) among all models.\n",
    "- SVC achieves high precision, recall, and F1-scores for both non-academic and academic classes, indicating strong overall performance.\n",
    "- **Naïve Bayes** has a lower accuracy (79.51%) compared to SVC and lower precision, recall, and F1-scores for academic-related data.\n",
