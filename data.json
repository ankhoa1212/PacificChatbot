If your scores are significantly lower than our class averages (below 20), we recommend retaking the Dental Admissions Test (DAT). There is not a deadline to take the DAT, but preference for admission is given to students who provide final DAT scores no later than November for any given admissions cycle. The committee reviews only the most recent DAT scores provided.For instructions on how to schedule a date for the DAT, please visit theAmerican Dental Association (ADA)website.Q: Are there particular courses that would best prepare me for dental school?A: The Admissions Committee encourages every student to develop his or her course of study in conjunction with the college or university predental advisor. If a school does not have a predental advisor, the student should consult faculty members in the chemistry and biology departments to select courses that meet the intent of the predental requirements. We recommend you select courses that extend the content of biomedical sciences, such as anatomy, histology, biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology.Q: What level of performance is the Admissions Committee looking for in my academic history?A: Many of our successful applicants completed three or more terms of full-time study at a college within the last three years. Full-time study is defined as four or more courses per term. In each term, three of the four courses should be predental science courses approved for biology majors. Applicants should achieve a B or better in each course; no D, W, F or I grades. Our incoming class grade point averages (GPA) are 3.6 overall and 3.5 science.Q: Are there elective courses that would help prepare me to be a good dentist?A: To develop your doctor/patient relationship skills, we recommend a course in journalism, public speaking, debate, interpersonal relationships, or drama.To prepare you for managing your own business, we recommend accounting for small business, marketing for the small business, consumer behavior or economics courses.To enhance your hand skills, we recommend course work in mechanical drafting/drawing, jewelry making, sculpting or ceramics.Q: Does Pacific require a secondary application?A: No. You need only to file anAssociated American Dental School Application Service (AADSAS)application.

Invitations for interview are extended by phone and confirmed by email. Most of our interviews are conducted from September through March. By May, all applicants will be notified by mail as to the final decision on their application.Q: What are the selection factors for an interview at Pacific?A: The Admissions Committee carefully considers each applicant's scholastic record, scores on the DAT, AADSAS essay, letters of evaluation, evidence of manual dexterity (including the perceptual ability portion of the DAT) and other personal attributes and qualities as well as demonstration of his or her understanding about a career in the dental profession.Applicants who appear to meet the requirements will be invited to the dental school in San Francisco for an interview with one or more members of the Admissions Committee.

Applicants who are offered the opportunity to enroll must complete planned coursework at a specified performance level.The Executive Admissions Committee reserves the right to override admissions recommendations made by faculty interviewers.Q: If I have applied to your dental school in previous years, am I guaranteed admission next year?A: No. Our dental school has one of the largest applicant pools in the country.

During the on-campus events, attendees are given a tour of the program facilities. Campus tours are offered during admission interviews.Due to the high volume of applicants, we are unable to offer unscheduled campus tours. See our full listing ofupcoming events.Do you offer one-on-one advising sessions/transcript review sessions?Unfortunately, due to the volume of applicants, and in order to ensure fairness in the evaluation of applicants, we are unable to meet individually with applicants.

However, it does strengthen your application if there is some recent coursework.My bachelor\u2019s degree will not be completed until after the admissions cycle closes. However, I have completed all other prerequisites. Can I still apply?No. In order to meet all prerequisites, your degree must be awarded and appear on an official transcript at the time of application submission.Do I need to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE)?The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is not required, but applicants can elect to submit their scores at the time of testing using the designated institution (DI) code 7363. If you have previously taken the GRE and would like to submit your scores, University of the Pacific\u2019s GRE code is 4065. Scores are valid for 5 years perETSwebsite.How do you calculate my GPA?We use CASPA calculated GPAs, specifically the Overall Total GPA and Overall Science GPA. We will not recalculate GPAs for admissions purposes. It is therefore very important that all grades have posted and appear on your transcript prior to submitting your application.Learn more about how CASPA calculates GPAs.Are pass/fail courses acceptable for prerequisite courses?Pass/fail courses are acceptable to meet prerequisite courses if taken at an accredited US institution. Please note, pass/fail courses do not affect your GPA per CASPA\u2019s GPA calculation policy.Learn more about how CASPA calculates GPAs.Is there a minimum grade for prerequisite courses?The minimum allowable grade for prerequisite courses is a C-.

Note: AP/CLEP credits cannot be used to meet science prerequisites.If AP credits are lumped together on your transcript without course credit equivalencies (i.e. AP credits \u2013 12.0), please request a letter of explanation for AP credits from your university\u2019s Registrar. Once obtained, please upload the letter to CASPA to accompany your application materials. The letter must be on university letterhead or bear the seal of the institution.I have vertebrate (or another type of) anatomy. Will that satisfy the Human Anatomy requirement?No, we require Human Anatomy to satisfy the Human Anatomy prerequisite requirement.I have one composition class and one literature class. Do I need to take another composition class to satisfy the English requirement?No. As long as you have successfully completed at least one composition course, we will accept a literature, writing-intensive, or composition course to complete the requirement. AP/CLEP credit (if recorded on a transcript) may also be used to fulfill the English requirement.I am an international medical graduate. Which services do you accept for academic evaluation?We will only accept the World Education Services (WES) evaluation of foreign training. CASPA will also accept the WES evaluation of transcripts so this is the required service for our program. For more information visitwww.wes.org.Is the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) required? If so, what is the cut-off score?Please consult theTOEFL flowchart. The TOEFL cut off score is 100. TOEFL scores are valid for two years after the test date perETSwebsite. IELTS scores can be substituted for the TOEFL exam with a cut-off score of 7.0.CASPA allows up to 5 letters of recommendation, but your program only requires 2. If I submit 5, will they all be considered, or will you pick only 2 to read?Our admissions committee considers the letters of recommendation as a whole, so if you have more than 2, they will all be considered. It is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage to your application if you have more than the 2 required letters.Health Care ExperienceWhat type of health care experience will satisfy the health care experience requirement?We do not consider one type of clinical experience greater than another (i.e. experience as an RN is not more valued than that of a medical assistant). Experience may be paid or unpaid. We do not accept hours accrued for academic credit or as part of a training or experiential learning course/program.Examples of experiences that typically satisfy the HCE requirement:Athletic TrainerCertified Nursing Assistant (CNA)* Must be licensed.ChiropractorChiropractor AssistantDental HygienistDieticianEKG/EEG TechnicianEmergency Medical Technician (Basic or Intermediate)Emergency Room TechnicianMedical Assistant (Back Office)Medical ScribeMilitary Medic or CorpsmanNurseOccupational TherapistOccupational Therapy Assistant or AideOphthalmic/Optometric Assistant / TechnicianParamedicPharmacistPhlebotomistPhysical TherapistPhysical Therapy Aide/Tech/AssistantRadiological TechnicianRehabilitation TechnicianRespiratory TherapistSurgical Technician / AssistantUltrasound TechnicianExamples of experiences that typically do not satisfy the HCE requirement:Basic Caregivers & CompanionsBehavioral Health TechniciansBilling / InsuranceCaring for family membersCase Management, Records ManagementClinical Care ExtenderDietary Aide / ClerkGreeterHealth EducatorsLifeguardingMedical Translation / InterpretingMedical Transcription / Virtual ScribePatient NavigatorPatient TransporterPersonal TrainersPharmacy Clerks (Retail)ShadowingVeterinary care or other experiences working with animalsExperiences mainly administrative in natureAny experience accrued for academic credit or as part of a training or experiential learning course/programAt a minimum, the applicant's clinical experience should include one of the following:Collecting of, and/or reporting in the patient's chart, data necessary to establish a diagnosis or evaluate the progress of the patient's treatment plan;Assisting a health care worker in the performance of diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures;Under the supervision of a health care provider administering or dispensing medications;Other work involving direct patient contact and interaction.HCE credit is determined by the duties you performed, not solely by job title. It is imperative when completing your application to include a detailed description of your job duties to ensure the Admissions Team can accurately determine HCE applicability.If you are not sure if your experience will satisfy the requirement please contact the program atPAprogram@pacific.edufor further clarification.Should I still apply if I won\u2019t have 1,000 hours by the application deadline?The program requires a minimum of 1,000 hours of health care experience (accrued at the time of application). If you will not be able to accumulate at least 1,000 hours of health care experience by the deadline, then you should wait to apply during a future cycle. The program does not project hours up to our application deadline or matriculation, but rather considers the number of hours accrued at the time you submit your application.Application Submission & CASPAI made a mistake/omission on my application. I have now fixed the issue. Can you re-evaluate my application with the new information?Unfortunately, we use the CASPA application, as submitted and verified, to make admission decisions. We know the application is a snapshot in time, however, we must have stability in applications to make an \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison between applicants. Accordingly, we will not accept any changes to submitted and verified CASPA applications within a given application cycle. Thus, it is imperative that applicants review their applications thoroughly prior to submission.Can I submit supplemental application materials to the program?We do not have a supplemental application. Please do not submit documents directly to the program unless requested. We use the Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) program to keep all of your application documents in one secure online location. We encourage you to make sure to include all pertinent information in your initial CASPA application, as it is sometimes difficult to add documents later.My grades have now posted for courses that were in progress when I submitted my CASPA application. Can you recalculate my GPA?We use CASPA-calculated GPAs, specifically the Overall Total GPA and Overall Science GPA. We will not recalculate GPAs for admissions purposes. It is therefore very important that all grades have posted and appear on your transcript prior to submitting your application.All applicants who are offered a seat in the class will have their GPAs verified prior to matriculation to ensure that any non-prerequisite, in-progress courses, maintained a GPA, in both overall total and overall science calculations, above the required 3.0.Learn more about how CASPA calculates GPAs.Can I use CASPA\u2019s professional transcript entry service for my coursework?Yes. Please keep in mind that the professional transcript entry service requires additional time once you have submitted your application. If you utilize the service, plan to submit your application early enough to allow for the extra steps to be verified by our deadlines. \u00a0For more information about professional transcript entry, please refer to theCASPA Help Center.What is your timeline for reviewing applications, interviewing candidates, and selecting a class?We will review each application once it has been verified by CASPA and delivered to our program. CASPA states that the average application is verified within 2 weeks. Until it is verified by CASPA, our program is unable to provide you with any information regarding the status of your application. Upon CASPA verification, your application will undergo a complete, holistic review, beginning with verification of prerequisite completion. The application review process can take several weeks; however, it is not uncommon to receive a response within a few days.Qualified applicants will be invited to interview for a position in our program. Interview invitations are extended throughout the admissions cycle at a rate determined by the quality of our applicant pool each year. Interviews take place from July through September, with our final class selection taking place no later than Oct 1.What is the application submission deadline? Do my transcripts need to be verified by CASPA by the deadline?Applications must be submitted and in \u201ccomplete\u201d status by 11:59 p.m. EST ( 8:59 p.m. PST) on Aug. 1. A complete date is given when an application is e-submitted and all transcripts, payments, and at least two letters of reference have been received by CASPA and attached to the application. Note: CASPA states that the average application will be verified within 2 weeks. It is up to the applicant to ensure that their application materials are submitted in a correct and timely manner so that the application can quickly move through the verification process. Exceptions are not granted, so be sure to plan ahead to meet the posted deadlines.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bI have substantial volunteer hours that I completed in high school. Should I include these hours in my application?We only review volunteer hours earned post-high school. Please do not include hours earned during or before high school.InterviewsDo you have rolling admissions or offer early acceptance?All seats will be offered after the final interviews have been conducted. Due to our admissions timelines and in fairness to all applicants, we do not offer early admission.I was invited for an interview. What will the format of the interview day look like?The interview day lasts several hours and consists of an orientation, panel interview, and group interview. Tours of the program facilities and campus are included.I was invited for an interview. Can I bring updated materials (r\u00e9sum\u00e9, transcripts, letters of recommendation, etc.) to the interview?We use the Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) program to keep all of your application documents in one secure online location. We will not accept any documents on the interview day. Please do not submit documents directly to the program unless requested.I received a notification that I will not be offered a seat in the class this cycle. What can I do to improve my application for the next cycle?With more than 2,500 applicants for 45 seats, the applicant pool is deep and competitive and most programs do not have the time or staffing to give applicants who did not meet their criteria feedback about how to improve their application. We do not offer specific advice for applicants; however, if you look at the average matriculant to PA school in 2019, you can get an idea of what a competitive applicant looks like. The average matriculant had a BS degree in biology or health sciences, a GPA of 3.58, 3,240 hours of health care experience involving direct patient care, and variable volunteer work. (PAEA, 2019). Every program has certain things they are looking for, so there is not any solitary thing to focus on, but you will want to be competitive with those that are matriculating and pay attention to the program mission. You may also want to consult our matriculant data on thePA Program Datapage.Is there an alternate list for acceptance?With a robust and highly competitive applicant pool, we cannot accept every qualified applicant. During class selection each September, the admissions committee selects applicants for the alternate list. Applicants can expect to be notified of their alternate status no later than Oct. 1. The alternate list is ranked; however, the rankings are not public and will not be shared. Alternates can expect to be offered a seat in the class up until Feb. 1.Back to Physician Assistant StudiesStockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

Only courses titled Group Communication, Verbal Communication, Written Communication or closely related titles will be accepted. It is not enough for a course to have an \u201cextensive writing or communication component\u201d or be too specific in one form of writing. All applicants, regardless of their academic or professional background, must complete each of the prerequisites to be considered for admission to the program.Back to topCan one course satisfy multiple prerequisites?No, each course may only satisfy one prerequisite.Back to topHow can an applicant fulfill the Human Development Across the Lifespan course requirement?The course may be offered through a human development or psychology department but must touch upon human development from birth until death. This course requirement can be fulfilled by a series of courses which combined are worth at least three semester units.Back to topIs there a certain grade requirement for the prerequisite courses?Yes, applicants must receive a cumulative GPA of3.2or better in all prerequisite coursework. It is best practice to have a B or better in all nursing prerequisites.Back to topCan prerequisites be waived?No, applicants must complete all prerequisites, regardless of their prior academic or professional backgrounds.Back to topIs AP Credit Accepted?No, we do not accept AP credit in place for prerequisite coursework.GeneralWhat degree will I earn?Master of Science in Nursing (MSN).Back to topHow long is the program?Full time for 24 months and 90 units (six consecutive semesters). The program averages 15 to 16 units per semester.Back to topWhen does the program begin?The ELMSN program admits 40 students twice a year. Admitted students begin in August or January. Applicants must submit their applications approximately eight months in advance.Back to topCan I apply if I want to be a family nurse practitioner but I am not a registered nurse?Prospective students first need to be a registered nurse before applying to a family nurse practitioner program. One option is to complete a Master\u2019s Entry Program in Nursing. Graduates are eligible to apply to a Post-MSN family nurse practitioner certificate program upon licensure or apply to a DNP FNP program.Back to topDoes the ELMSN prepare students to become a licensed registered nurse?Yes, the program provides California Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) approved coursework and clinical experiences needed in preparation for the National Council Licensing Examination (NCLEX) to practice as a registered nurse. Upon completion of the entire ELMSN program, students are eligible to take the NCLEX exam to become licensed registered nurses.Back to topWhat is the difference between the Bachelor of Science in Nursing and the Master\u2019s Entry Program in Nursing (ELMSN)?The Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree is an undergraduate program that allows students to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree as they prepare to become registered nurses. The ELMSN is a graduate program designed for individuals who already earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in a different field and seek to transition into clinical nursing and leadership roles.Back to topWhat is the difference between MSN and ELMSN?Both programs are graduate nursing programs, however, MSN is designed for students who already earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in Nursing and seek to further their nursing education. ELMSN is designed for individuals with a bachelor\u2019s degree in another discipline who seek to transition into nursing.Back to topHow is ELMSN program unique?The curriculum incorporates the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (2021) New Educational Standards (Domains). As healthcare is shifting to a community-based model, students will complete coursework in epidemiology, population health, advanced pharmacology and a Public Health Certificate coursework. In addition, the program curriculum was based on best practices as identified through nursing education research. Some of the highlights of this approach are case-based, problem-based learning, and simulation. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, ELMSN graduates are in the highest demand of all nursing programs and earn the highest salaries upon graduation. Also, California employment data (2019) of nursing graduates demonstrated a preference by employers for the ELMSN graduates.Back to topApplication informationStudents applying to ELMSN must complete a\u202fNursingCAS\u202fapplication and meet selection criteria. Following that process, qualified applicants who are verified by NursingCAS will be eligible for an interview conducted online or in person.How often are applications accepted?We accept applications twice a year for an August or January start.Back to topHow does one distinguish her or himself as a strong applicant?Given the competitive applicant pool, we recommend that each applicant submits a thorough and complete application prior to the deadline. Applicants' ability to articulate why they would like to become a nurse weighs heavily in the evaluation process. This should be clearly communicated in the essay.Back to topHow many letters of recommendation are required and from whom? Can letters of recommendation be sent directly to the school?We require three letters of recommendation. Please use recommenders who can speak to your academic performance, or your professional performance (e.g., faculty, employers). Hard copies are not accepted. Instead, submit your letters of recommendation through NursingCAS (PDF, Word document or by pasting text). References should be current within the last two years and should describe the applicant\u2019s strengths and potential as well as any concerns for completing the program and moving forward with a successful career in nursing.Back to topWhat should be included in the essays?The essays provide an opportunity to describe the applicant\u2019s reasons for pursuing a master's degree and for choosing the graduate nursing program at University of Pacific. The prompt will be posted in the NursingCAS application.Back to topDo I need experience in the healthcare field? Is experience preferred?No, it is not necessary to obtain acceptance into the ELMSN program. This program is designed for people without experience in healthcare. The admissions committee finds that students with degrees in other disciplines are often transferable to nursing. While experience is not required, exposure to professional healthcare and the ability to discuss your understanding of the RN role will strengthen your application.Back to topHow do I pay my application fee?All application fees require payments by credit card. Only cards with Visa and Master Card logos will be accepted. No checks, money orders or cash will be accepted.Back to topWhat if I do not have a Visa or Master Card?Payment may be made with a Visa or Master Card prepaid gift card which can be purchased at many major chain stores or online. Please be aware that the gift card must contain a balance sufficient to cover the application fee in one full payment.Back to topIMPORTANT:Your application and materials must have a \u201ccomplete\u201d (all materials received and pending verification) or \u201cverified\u201d status by the deadline. It is the applicants' responsibility to monitor the status of their applications and application materials on a regular basis. NursingCAS does NOT notify applicants if applications are incomplete or if documents are missing. Only applications and application materials with a \"complete\" or \"verified\" status by the deadline are considered for admission. For more information on application status, please visit the NursingCAS\u2019 Applicant Help Center.GPAWhat is the minimum GPA requirement?The minimum overall bachelor\u2019s degree GPA requirement is 3.0anda 3.2 in the last 60 units. The minimum nursing overall prerequisite GPA requirement is 3.2.Back to topHow do you calculate an applicant\u2019s bachelor\u2019s degree GPA? Do you use the NursingCAS calculation?We use the overall GPA fromallcollege coursework calculated by NursingCAS based on the coursework reported by the applicant and verified with transcripts by NursingCAS.Back to topIf my overall GPA is below a 3.0 or my nursing prerequisite GPA is below a 3.2, am I still eligible to apply?No, all applicants must meet the minimum GPA requirements listed on the website.Back to topCan I retake classes to improve my GPA?An applicant\u2019s overall bachelor\u2019s degree GPA is final upon graduation. Taking additional courses or repeating courses after receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree does not affect a bachelor\u2019s degree GPA. However, Nursing prerequisite courses completed or repeated after graduation are calculated into the overall, last 60 unit, and nursing perquisite GPA.Back to topHow will repeated courses be calculated into my GPA?If the course was repeated at the degree-granting institution prior to graduation, the GPA calculation is determined by the school\u2019s grade-forgiveness policy.\u00a0Repeated prerequisites will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.Back to topWhat courses are used to calculate the prerequisite science GPA?Human Anatomy with lab (4 units), Human Physiology with lab (4 units), Microbiology or Bacteriology with lab (4 units), Statistics or Epidemiology (3 units), Nutrition (3 units), Sociology or Social Science (3 units), Communication (total 6 units), written and oral communication, and Psychology are all used to calculate your nursing prerequisite GPA.Back to topDoes the School of Nursing look at the entire undergraduate transcript or just the last 60 units of the undergraduate GPA?All college coursework is reviewed and calculated for an overall GPA. We also review and calculate the last 60 units.Back to topTime commitment and class scheduleCan students in the ELMSN program be part-time?No, this program requires a full-time commitment.Back to topWhere will the classes take place?Classes take place at the School of Health Sciences on Pacific\u2019s Sacramento campus.Back to topCan students work while enrolled in ELMSN?Be advised that the program requires a very intensive, full-time commitment from students. It is strongly recommended that you do not work or entertain other commitments outside of the program while enrolled.Back to topHow often are students in class during the program?Students can expect to be on campus full-time for the duration of the program in preparation for licensure. Most courses are held Monday through Friday, however, some courses and clinical experiences are held in the evenings or on weekends. For clinical rotations, students\u2019 often complete clinical rotations one to two days a week. In the final semester of the program, students will complete a precepted immersion experience, which requires you to be available Monday to Sunday to work two 12-hour shifts aligned with the assigned preceptor\u2019s schedule. This can include weekends and nights.Back to topWhat are the clinical experiences like?Clinical placements take place every semester for about 15-24 hours per week. Students complete clinical experiences in acute and ambulatory care, home and community. Students also participate in simulations (including high- and mid-fidelity patient simulators, standardized patients, task trainers and computer simulations) and are required to have reliable transportation to travel up to 50 miles for select rotations.Back to topBack to Nursing ProgramStockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

This program is being phased in over the course of three years, beginning with the class of 2016, students are required to complete (a.) either an Externship or Legal Clinic (3 units minimum), and (b.) a minimum of 8 units of simulation and practicum courses, including at least one simulation course and at least one practicum course.What is a Clinic or Externship?Through the Externship Program and Legal Clinics, students can get hands-on legal experience, putting the theory. They put the theory learned in the classroom into practice in an on-campus or hybrid clinic, or a field placement in a government agency or non-profit setting. Students in the on campus clinics represent real clients under careful supervision and all clinical and field placement students gain real-world legal skills.What is a Simulation Course?Simulation Courses (formerly referred to as Experiential Courses) are courses where students learn by doing, and in which the vast majority of instruction is devoted to professional skills and values required of practicing lawyers. Such courses enable students to integrate legal theory, professional skills, and professional identity.What is a Practicum Course?Practicum Courses are courses in which at least one-third of instruction is devoted to a professional skill or set of professional skills characteristically used by practicing lawyers. Practicum courses give students the opportunity to learn substantive law and also learn and appreciate the context in which that law is to be applied by working on lawyer-like projects on simulated legal matters.How will I know which courses qualify?By their very nature, these courses tend to be dynamic, cutting-edge offerings. From year-to-year the list of qualifying courses will change to reflect legal trends and interesting opportunities for McGeorge students. For example, in Spring 2014, we were able to offer a Practice Skills for Eminent Domain Lawyers simulation class taught by a partner from Downey Brand, in collaboration with the City of Sacramento. Each year, a list of qualifying courses is published online on theOffice of the Registrar page.May I take extra experiential courses?Space permitting, yes. Some students select both a clinic and a field placement and several practicums and simulations! Students report that the courses in the Experiential Curriculum prepare them well for the practice of law.What if I cannot meet the Clinic/Externship Requirement because of my job?Students who work full time (approximately 40 hours/wk) during normal business hours may request a waiver of the Externship/Legal Clinic portion of the Experiential Curriculum. Waiver requests will be reviewed by the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs or the Associate Dean and granted for good cause only. Waiver forms are available at the Office of the Registrar or the Office of Student Affairs.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

The degree is innovative and versatile and meant for professionals who seek the benefits of advanced training in legal reasoning and analysis. The degree enhances many professions and is ideal for business executives, entrepreneurs, policymakers, human resource and other professionals in today\u2019s economy. With so many businesses and industries being impacted by constantly changing laws and regulations, having knowledge and training in legal analysis can be advantageous in dealing with those everyday law-related issues.What can I do with an MSL degree?Because the law intersects with every industry in one way or another, it is very likely there is some aspect of your current role that could be enhanced with a MSL degree. Our MSL degree can also open career opportunities by allowing you to pivot your career toward the legal aspects of your field. For example, someone working in government affairs may take courses in lobbying, election law, and statutory interpretation. Individuals working with water and environmental issues may take courses in water resources law, environmental law, and water and environmental justice.Through our MSL coursework, you'll be better equipped to:Review and understand agreements such as contractsReview and draft proposed local, state, and federal laws and regulationsUnderstand and comply with regulatory requirements for specific industriesWork with attorneys and compliance officersWhat can I expect in terms of workload?Typical students will take six units in each semester. The general rule of thumb is that for every hour you spend in the \u201cclassroom,\u201d you can expect another 1.5 \u2013 3 hours of additional studying.How many courses must I complete in order to earn an MSL degree?Students must complete 26 credits. Please refer to the program\u2019s curriculum web page for a complete list of required and elective courses.Who teaches the classes?The classes are taught by a combination of McGeorge\u2019s full-time faculty members and highly qualified adjunct instructors. Many of the adjunct instructors are practitioners in the fields of water law and environmental law. We encourage you to view the faculty bios and send us an email atgraduatelaw@pacific.eduif you would like to connect with a McGeorge professor.What is required as part of the application?An application containing the following items is required: Official transcripts for all universities and colleges that you have attended, a resume or curriculum vitae, a personal statement, a writing sample, and one (required) or two (preferred) letters of recommendation. For more information, see MSL Admission.How are admissions decisions communicated to applicants?All decisions will be communicated to applicants via email. If you are admitted, a formal letter will be attached to the email.If I am accepted, how much time will I have to decide whether to enroll or not?Applications are accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis with a commitment required by April 1 (Fall start) or Nov. 1 (Spring start). The sooner you apply, the longer span of time you will have to make a decision that will work best for you. If an applicant submits their application materials after these dates, they will have two weeks from the time a decision is rendered to pay a seat deposit and commit to the program. Extensions to this two-week rule may be granted on a case-by-case basis.Is financial aid available?Yes, students may be eligible for financial aid. Please contact our Financial Aid office at 916.739.7158 or finaid@pacific.edu. We also offer a Dean\u2019s Scholarship to highly qualified applicants.Individuals who have earned educational benefits through the Veterans Administration can use their benefits at McGeorge. You are responsible for confirming your eligibility with the VA. McGeorge is a 100% Yellow Ribbon matching institution.Is it possible for my employer to cover all or part of the tuition?Applicants should check with their individual employers. Of the companies that do assist with tuition payments, some have a limit on the amount of tuition that can be covered in any given year. We encourage you to reach out to your Human Resources department to see if this benefit is available to you.When do classes begin?Students may begin the online program in either the Fall (August) or Spring (January) semester. The exact date that the academic terms begin varies from year to year so please reference the academic calendar.Do I need to participate in an orientation?An online orientation program is required for all program participants. Orientation will be available the week before the start of each semester.How are the online courses organized? Are they self-paced?Most courses within McGeorge online graduate programs are offered on a semester-long basis, with weekly modules. Although format may vary depending on the nature of the course, in most courses students should expect to be assigned new topics each week, with associated reading, lecture, discussion, exercises, quizzes, and other interactive activities. Individual topics that include a specific group of reading assignments, lectures, discussion, and exercises are called modules. Most courses will release new modules each Monday and allow one week for completion.Within the weekly modules, most McGeorge online courses will be primarily asynchronous. This means that students do not necessarily need to be online at the same time, and will have the flexibility to complete module activities at a time convenient to their schedules, as long as they complete the activities by the assigned, typically weekly, deadline. Some assignments, such as weekly discussion, may have mid-week deadlines. Some papers or projects may be assigned over several weeks or the course of a semester. To facilitate planning, all deadlines will be announced in the syllabus prior to the beginning of a course.What are the technical requirements for the online programs?Students need to have regular and reliable access to a computer and high-speed Internet. Note that mobile and tablet devices will not provide full access; students will need a laptop or desktop computer with a webcam.Are courses offered during the summer?There will be two units available over the summer. One of these units will have an optional residential requirement. While this is not required, we highly recommend your participation in the option residential opportunity.Is there a residential component?There is no requirement for an online student to come to our Sacramento campus. However, we highly recommend students to participate in the 1-unit hybrid summer course or come to campus for additional learning opportunities.I live in a state outside of California, can I apply?Per the Department of Education, we must be authorized to educate students in any particular state, therefore only students from pre-authorized states may participate in this program.

Students will be alerted to opportunities to participate in on-campus events through live-streaming and similar technology. If you are able to visit campus, we are happy to provide a campus tour, to introduce you to faculty, to connect with professionals in your area of concentration, and to participate in academic and social events.

We want to make it easier on you! Here are answers to some of the questions we know you\u2019re wondering about.How do I pay for Pacific?The sticker price of attending any college or university can be jarring, but that\u2019s not what you\u2019ll be paying out of pocket. Most students who attend Pacific receive financial aid.\u00a0\u00a0If you submitted a FAFSA and added University of the Pacific, you were automatically considered for federal grants. If you qualify, they will be listed on your financial aid offer letter.If you haven\u2019t submitted your FAFSA, it\u2019s not too late! Apply atfafsa.ed.gov, and be sure to add Pacific \u2014 our school code is 001329. Apply even if you think you won\u2019t qualify \u2014 you might be surprised!When you applied to Pacific, you were automatically considered for a merit award, which is similar to a grant in that you don\u2019t have to pay it back. These are based on academic achievement.\u00a0If you qualify for work-study, it also will be listed on your financial aid offer letter. Work-study jobs not only provide income, but you\u2019ll gain experience and make connections! You can find work-study jobs using Handshake, Pacific\u2019s online job board.You might also consider taking out a student loan, but be sure to research the differences between federal and private loans. Students can qualify for federal loans regardless of income that was listed on the FAFSA and generally have better terms.Once you\u2019ve started attending Pacific, be sure to work with your academic advisor, who will help you plan your degree track so you can finish in the least amount of time possible (and thus pay less for college), if that\u2019s what you desire.For more information about the differences between grants, work-study and loans, and more financial aid resources, visitgo.Pacific.edu/FinancialAid. We hold financial aid webinars for admitted students most Wednesdays through May; be sure to check them out when you\u2019re on the financial aid website!What kind of jobs and internships can help me pay for Pacific?Many students choose to work part-time while attending\u00a0Pacific. Our Career Resource Center can help you find jobs and paid internships, or you can search for yourself on Handshake, Pacific\u2019s online job and opportunity board. It\u2019s easy and common for students to find work\u00a0on campus \u2013 get your resume drafted up and make an appointment atCareer Servicesto get started!Is the food actually good?Without exaggeration, the food on\u00a0Pacific\u2019s\u00a0campus is gourmet.\u00a0In cooperation with our food service provider, Bon Appetit, we strive to provide healthy, delicious meals for every diet using only the freshest\u00a0of ingredients.\u00a0At ourMarketplace, get made-to-order omelets, deli sandwiches, customized pasta and, of course, our famous breakfast burritos\u00a0and more.

We\u00a0get\u00a0it. Pacific has plenty ofhousing options, including Residential Learning Communities (check out ourInstagram Guideon those)!\u00a0Since you\u2019re a new student, you\u2019ll most likely be living in Grace Covell Hall\u00a0or The Quad Communities, which\u00a0both have\u00a0spacious rooms, communal lounges and well-maintained facilities.You can see more\u00a0about\u00a0our residence halls\u00a0on\u00a0our Instagram Highlight: Housing.

What do I need to know about college?Congratulations! The Pacific community is home to a large population of first-generation college students, and we think that makes us\u00a0pretty special.\u00a0Though it can be intimidating, know you\u2019re not alone. Our campus provides resources specifically for first-generation students, like\u00a0First Generation Friday events, support groups atCounseling and Psychological Servicesand\u00a0student organizations dedicated to cultural and academic support.\u00a0We also have other academic\u00a0assistance services, like theStudent Writing Center, free\u00a0academic\u00a0tutoring\u00a0andcareer\u00a0services. And don\u2019t forget that your faculty advisor is there to make sure you graduate and that you are finding and pursuing your passions, so never hesitate to ask for help!What are the campus vibes?The\u00a0Pacific campus is notoriously friendly! In fact, it\u2019s nearly impossible to walk across our campus and not see a friend, classmate, professor\u00a0or staff member you love. Though our faculty and staff on campus are certainly the kindest and\u00a0most\u00a0dedicated people you\u2019ll find at any college, Pacific students truly make our campus a community of love and acceptance. You won\u2019t be competing against your classmates;\u00a0you\u2019ll be working alongside them, supporting each other through some of those tough college courses. So, a word of advice:\u00a0If you don\u2019t want to chat with a dozen friendly faces on your way to class, invest in some headphones and a hoodie.Can and should I bring my car?You\u00a0can\u00a0bring your vehicle,\u00a0and you will need to purchase aparking permitfor just\u00a0$100/year\u00a0to park on campus.\u00a0If you don\u2019t bring your car, you can still explore our\u00a0city!\u00a0Stockton\u2019s public transportation is nationally ranked and one of the first all-electric fleets in California.

Students Supervised Clinical Practice Experience (SCPE) courses (NUTR 287A&B) take place at clinical education sites throughout California and some out-of-state facilities.Do I have to locate my own supervised experiential learning sites and/or preceptors?The MSCN program is responsible for identifying SPCE clinical education sites and preceptors and creates the rotation schedule for each student depending on site availability and student needs.

While students\u2019 interests and residence location are elicited and reviewed, the MSCN program cannot guarantee that placements are near their residence. MSCN students can expect to be placed at clinical education sites throughout California. Out-of-state placements can also be considered and discussed with the student at facilities affiliated with Pacific. The program aims to provide adequate notice of placements, so students can make their arrangements for commuting or temporary housing, which is at the student\u2019s expense.Cost and Financial AidHow much does it cost to attend the MSCN program?Our program provides a helpful at-a-glance summary ofTuition and Estimated Expenses.

Don't worry. We have compiled a list of frequently asked questions just for that purpose.What is the Powell Match?The Powell Match was established through the transformative $125 million Powell Fund, a gift from the estate of Robert and Jeannette Powell. An astute businessman, Bob Powell appreciated an opportunity to leverage his philanthropy to inspire others, and with this program, he continues to do so. The Powells did not graduate from college themselves, yet served as members of the Pacific Board of Regents for many years and believed deeply in the value of a Pacific education. The Powell Fund matches new endowment gifts to Pacific, up to 1:1. More than $60 million is allocated for endowed scholarship matches and $25 million for endowed academic program matches.What is an endowment?An endowment is a permanent fund at the University established with contributions from donors that will be invested in perpetuity. Each year, a portion of the value of the fund is distributed to support the donor's purpose such as student scholarships or program support. Any earnings in excess of this distribution build the fund's market value. The University's current endowment spending policy is 4.0% of market value. Learn more about endowments.What types of endowments qualify for the match?Endowed funds that provide scholarships or academic support to our faculty and academic programs are eligible for the Powell Match Program. Examples of academic program endowments could include support for a specific department, a faculty position, or student learning opportunities such as academic competitions (e.g., forensics or trial advocacy), a lecture series or experiential learning programs. Examples of scholarship endowments could include gap grants, middle-income scholarships, merit scholarships or study abroad scholarships. From the Powell gift, more than $60 million is allocated for endowed scholarship matches and $25 million for endowed academic program matches.What types and size gifts are eligible for the Powell Match?Gifts of $50,000 or more to establish or enhance an endowment may be eligible to receive a Powell Match. Previously unmatched gifts made after October 1, 2012 may be considered for the match if an additional gift or commitment to the endowment is made. Gifts of cash, stock or other assets, including pledges of up to 5 years in length, qualify for 1:1 matching so long as the assets can be liquidated within a 5-year period.Do I have to make my gift in one payment?It is not necessary to make your gift all in one payment. However, neither the match nor the distribution will occur until the University has received the minimum $50,000. Payment schedules of various lengths may be established by the donor with a maximum duration of five years.How long do I have to fund my endowment?Once a gift and or pledge agreement is signed, the donor has a maximum of five years to reach the minimum required $50,000 to guarantee the Powell Match.Who is eligible for the match?Gifts from individual donors or couples, a group of individuals, family foundations or family owned businesses are all eligible to be matched by the Powell Fund.Can more than one person give to the endowment and be matched?Yes! One or more donors may give to an endowment.\u00a0Once that endowment reaches the $50,000 minimum, each and every additional gift will be matched on a quarterly basis for as long as matching funds are available.Does my employer's company qualify for the match as well?The Powell Fund will match both your gift and your company's matching contribution. Your company's match can also count toward the $50,000 minimum to qualify for the Powell Match. \u00a0So in effect, between the Powell Fund Match and a 1:1 match from your employer, your gift will be quadrupled.Example:$50,000 donor gift + employer match + $100,000 Powell Match = $200,000 endowmentDo planned gifts (deferred gifts) qualify for the match?Planned (deferred) gifts are not eligible for matching.When will the match occur?The match is made available after a gift or payments received toward a pledge total $50,000 or more. Your endowment is established in the quarter that the minimum $50,000 is received. The Powell Match portion is added at the same time.When will a new endowment start being used?If the endowment is funded by June 30, it will have a full distribution (currently at 4%) annually starting the fall after one year of investment. If the endowment has met the minimum after June 30, but prior to Dec. 31, the fund will have a half distribution (2%) starting the following fall and then a full (4%) annual distribution each subsequent year.Gift AmountPowell MatchTotal EndowmentPayment ReceivedDistributionEstimated Amount$50,000$50,000$100,000June 30, 2019Fall 2020$4,000$50,000$50,000$100,000Dec. 31, 2019Fall 2020$2,000Fall 2021$4,000How do I get started?Contact any University of the Pacific gift officer or Tod Davis, Powell Match Manager, at 209.946.2502 ortdavis@pacific.edu.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

Any Accelerated Honors Program applicant who is not admitted to that program will be given full consideration for the traditional JD program.Can I enroll in the Accelerated Honors Program after my first year is completed?No. Unfortunately, we have structured the curriculum to start in the spring semester of the Accelerated Honors Students' first year.Am I eligible to participate in study abroad programs as an Accelerated Honors Program student?Participating in a study abroad program is possible if you coordinate and plan accordingly to ensure you are meeting all of the requirements including the honors externship. To stay on track with the accelerated program, you will need to earn externship credits either during the year or in your two other summers. You can fulfill the regular experiential requirement of two capstone experiences over the course of your second and third year, but will need to make up the 7 units from the first summer with a combination of summer coursework or additional units during intersession or during the remaining semesters.Is my tuition covered during my summer honors externship?Yes, you are eligible for seven credit hours of free summer tuition. This can be used for the externship or for summer courses if you opt to study abroad after your first year.What GPA do I need to have to remain in the Accelerated Honors Program and how is it calculated?You must maintain a 3.00 GPA. GPA is calculated the same for AHP and regular JD students. For the first year, GPA is calculated based on the fall and spring semesters. For the second year, GPA is calculated based on any course taken during the summer before the second year and the fall and spring semesters of the second year. AHP students stay with the same entering cohort (of both regular JD and AHP students) throughout their time at McGeorge for GPA calculations and ranking.If your GPA falls below 3.0, you will need to meet with the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs or the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs to discuss your academic planning. If you improve your GPA during your second year and continue your progress towards completion of your JD a semester early, you may still graduate with AHP recognition as long as your final GPA exceeds 3.0. You may also be advised to discontinue the acceleration of your JD pursuit and graduate without the AHP designation.Where do most of your student's extern?Most students in the accelerated honors program will participate in an externship during the first summer after they commence law school. Externships will be full time for 10 weeks, and students will earn seven (7) credits. Example of externship placements include:Trial and Appellate Judges (state and federal)California Attorney General's Office (various divisions)Fair Political Practice CommissionFranchise Tax BoardDistrict Attorney's OfficePublic Defender's OfficeCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency \u2013 State Water Resources Control BoardCalifornia Department of Human ResourcesChildren's Law CenterCalifornia Department of Managed Health CareOther externship placements at non-profit and governmental agencies and organizations are also available and each student will be individually placed with consideration given to her or his area of interest.What is the benefit of participating in the Accelerated Honors Program?Accelerated Honors students will obtain their law licenses and be eligible to start practicing while their peers are preparing for the bar exam and therefore will begin working as attorneys or policy makers six months ahead of their peers in traditional three-year full-time programs.Because students in the Accelerated Honors Program participate in a free summer externship as part of the program, students in McGeorge's unique program save thousands of dollars.The most accurate way to compare the cost of attending McGeorge's Accelerated Honors Program is to discount the total cost of attendance by the free summer externship and the six months of income students will earn while their peers are studying for and taking the bar exam and waiting for their results.What is the purpose of the interview requirement?The interview provides an opportunity for both parties to ensure that your participation in this program will provide you all the opportunities for success available. Your application allows us to ascertain certain things about you, but an interview gives us an opportunity to talk with you about your experiences and determine whether the accelerated honors program is likely to be a good fit for you.Can I participate in mock trial, moot court, law review if I am a member of the Accelerated Honors Program?Like all McGeorge students, you will have the opportunity to earn a spot on our competition teams and/or law review. Our teams are nationally recognized and participating in them brings many opportunities to hone your craft and prepare you for your legal career. Because Mock Trial and Moot Court are designed to be year-long experiences, participation in these activities in your third year may be somewhat restricted.What if I start in the Accelerated Honors Program and change my mind?No problem. Depending on when you decide, you will be able to take a lighter load of classes.\u00a0Once you have elected to drop the AHP program, reentry is not possible.What are the eligibility requirements?Competitive students will have excellent academic credentials and distinctive life experiences to support successful completion of an accelerated JD degree. Students with a 157 LSAT score and a 3.3 or better undergraduate grade point average (UGPA) or a 156 and 3.5 or better UGPA presumptively will qualify for an interview. Students whose entrance credentials do not meet these prerequisites may qualify for an interview if their LSAT score and UGPAs are similar to these requirements and other aspects of their application justify further evaluation of their candidacy for the program.How does the Accelerated Honors Program give me a competitive advantage in the legal employment market?It helps in two ways. First, it puts you in the legal market sooner at a time when many other legal graduates are not job-searching. Second, your designation as an Accelerated Honors graduate is a mark of distinction that is likely to be impressive to future employers.How will potential employers know that I've completed the Accelerated Honors JD Program?As a new program, many employees will likely be unfamiliar with what it required to complete your degree faster than average. Placing this on your resume will undoubtedly open the door for you to discuss the nuances of the program and your ability to perform at such a rigorous academic level. You will also receive a certificate upon graduation and a designation on the commencement program. Will I select my own summer honors externship or will one be assigned to me? McGeorge will provide a list of opportunities, and the Director of Externships will work with you personally to find the best fit for you. We have a wide range of approved externship sites and will be able to find an experience to align with your interests and experiences.If I do not maintain the required GPA for the Accelerated Honors JD Program, how will I be integrated into the traditional JD program?Your integration with the three-year program will be seamless. You will have been taking classes with students in the three-year curriculum all along, and you will continue to do so if you end up in the traditional program.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

For more information or to make an appointment, please emailpr@pacific.edu. Our complete policies and information can be found below.FormsApplications are available to students, faculty and other qualified professionals who wish to study the collection.Student Research Request FormFaculty Research Request FormVisiting Scholar Research Request FormPoliciesAccession and Deaccession of Human SkullsThe Atkinson Collection contains over 2400 accessioned human skulls, crania and mandibles. The majority of these individuals were acquired by Dr. Spencer R. Atkinson, an eminent orthodontist and craniofacial researcher, from 1919 to 1963. The University of the Pacific received his private collection in 1963. Subsequent additions have resulted from the dental school's human gross anatomy course during the early 1990s. More recently, a number of dental school alumni have donated skulls that they had purchased from biological supply houses during their dental school days.The Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study (CDHCS) makes every effort to ensure the continued security and preservation of donated skulls. Museum-quality cabinets and archival-quality trays house the Atkinson Collection. Specimens are handled minimally. During research studies involving examination of the skulls, curator assistance is mandatory.Acquisition GuidelinesSkulls donated to CDHCS must be recognizable as originally purchased from a biological supply house (i.e., specimen obviously prepared under laboratory conditions, with tissue removal, degreasing, and bleaching having resulted from standardized preparation techniques) or designated as non-Native American in ethnicity. Subsequent to receipt of a specimen, CDHCS staff may request a 30 day examination period if the specimen's derivation seems questionable.All acquisitions are to be outright and unconditional. Skull donations must be made with the understanding that, while the donor's preference may be taken into consideration, CDHCS staff will determine whether to accession the specimen into the main research collection or into the smaller teaching collection.Federal law prevents CDHCS from providing identification services or appraisal values for donated skulls. Donors are responsible for appraisals of value. Please contact biological supply houses or internet companies specializing in human osteological remains to determine approximate values. CDHCS is in no way affiliated with these organizations.Accession ProcessAccession RecordUpon receipt, the donation will be examined and described for accessioning purposes in an Accession Record. The donor will receive a copy of the Accession Record containing the following:Acquisition information: date received, CDHCS receiver's name, method of delivery of specimen to CDHCS;Donor information: donor's name, address, phone number and email address;Donation information: description of specimen, documentation relating to specimen, accession number and catalogue number(s) assigned;Donor Release statement: \"The objects listed above (and/or on attached list), when accepted by Museum Committee, become the sole and permanent property of Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study of the University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry. This gift is subject to no restrictions or conditions. Objects may be photographed or otherwise reproduced, exhibited or studied solely at the discretion of CDHCS. Determinations of value for tax purposes is the responsibility of the donor;\"Donor signature and date;Acceptance information (completed by CDHCS): indication of Museum Committee action to accept or reject donation;Name of recipient and date of return, if specimen is returned from CDHCS to donor.DeaccessioningAll donations to CDHCS are irrevocable upon the formal and physical transfer to CDHCS. Subsequent to accession, if a specimen is later deemed to fall outside CDHCS guidelines for acceptance, the donor will be contacted and the specimen deaccessioned and returned to the donor.Conditions Governing Skull LoansThe Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy and the P&S Comparative Anatomy skull collections are open to research by all qualified personnel. At the present time, all previous external loans have been recalled by University of the Pacific. Only limited future external loans will be considered. Loans will be assessed on their scientific merit, with priority given to maintaining the integrity of the collections.All loan requests must be submitted in writing on institutional letterhead and addressed to:CuratorAtkinson Collection, Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study (CDHCS)University of the Pacific, Arthur A.

No products incorporating or based on the borrowed specimens shall be produced without individualized contract document development and licensing approval by University of the Pacific. (See \"Commercial/Business Use and Images\" section for specific policy regarding images of specimens from the skull collections.) To initiate the loan procedure, the following information must be described in the commercial use loan request:Purpose of the loan, specifying all anticipated product development and product useList of specimen numbers or number and types of specimens requestedSpecific means of extracting product data from the specimens, including making casts, photographs, X-rays, CT scans, or other methodsLoan LimitationsTen specimens will be the maximum loaned at any one time. Loan requests subsequent to loan of the initial ten specimens will not be automatically granted and require submission of a new loan request. Rare specimens from the collections will not be loaned under any circumstances. Loans are not made internationally.Loan ConditionsBorrowerLoans are not made to individuals. Loans are made to non-profit, educational institutions for educational and scholarly purposes. If an individual researcher is affiliated with a museum, the loan agreement must be signed by the Director or Registrar of the receiving institution. If the individual researcher is affiliated with an academic department, the agreement must be signed by the department chairperson.Purpose of LoanSpecimens loaned by CDHCS may not be used for any purposes other than that agreed upon. Specimens may not be lent by the Borrower or individual researcher to a third party without the written permission of CDHCS.ScheduleAll non-teaching loans require a minimum of two months to process from the time that approval is granted and a final list of specimens is determined. Teaching loan requests should be submitted at least three weeks in advance.Loan Insurance for Loss/DamageThe borrower is responsible for the cost of insuring all borrowed specimens (and skull boxes used for transport) from the time they leave CDHCS until the time they are returned. Prior to releasing specimens for loan, CDHCS must receive from the borrower a memorandum and certificate of insurance from a fine arts insurance policy showing wall-to-wall coverage subject to standard exclusions with no deductible. Insurance coverage through the University of the Pacific is not available for purchase by the borrower.A borrower who wishes to insure objects under their own insurance coverage should submit a copy of their fine arts insurance policy listing any deductibles and exclusions for review by the University of the Pacific Office of Risk Management. This information should be submitted when the formal loan request is made.The certificate of insurance must show the value of each specimen to be insured for loss or damage as follows: adult, juvenile or in utero/newborn cranium or mandible, or both \u2014 $3000; cranium or mandible, or both, of a specimen exhibiting a pathological or anomalous condition (as determined by the CDHCS curator) \u2014 $5000. The borrower will be charged for any damage to specimens (see below) incurred during the loan period, including fragmentation of teeth, breakage of bone, and any other form of alteration of the specimens from their original loaned condition. Damage fees will be assessed between $50 - $200 per specimen per incident, based on the severity of the damage and time required for repair by CDHCS staff.Recall of LoanCDHCS reserves the right to recall the loan for any reason and requires return of the recalled loan within three weeks.Transportation/Packing/StorageThe method of transportation of loaned skulls is by hand carry only. The individual researcher, or a designated courier (CDHCS staff, or a professional courier approved by CDHCS and University of the Pacific), will hand carry the skulls to their destination. Each skull will be packed by CDHCS personnel in a loaned skull box with appropriate packing materials prior to transport. The skull boxes and packing material should be stored in appropriate facilities for preservation. The researcher will repack loans in the same or similar material. If a CDHCS staff member or outside professional is chosen as the courier, all courier expenses, including airline tickets, lodging, courier fee (for supervising unpacking, mounting, installation, de-installation, and repacking), and any other unforeseen expenditures will be paid by the borrower. At the designated destination, the researcher will make arrangements necessary for storage of the loaned skulls in a secured room prior to and after use.Care/PreservationThe individual researcher will protect loans from mishandling, dirt, insects, fire, theft, and extreme variations in light, temperature and humidity at all times. Loans will be handled only by the researcher and experienced professional assistants. Specimen handling will be kept to a minimum. The researcher and assistants will comply with all special handling instructions required by CDHCS in the Specimen Handling Guidelines. The researcher will not clean, repair or alter a loaned specimen (see below). CDHCS reserves the right to inspect the installation and/or use of specimens at any time.SecurityFor exhibit purposes, specimens must be displayed in closed, locked cases. For research or commercial purposes, specimens must be placed in closed, locked cases, so as not to be visible when in storage.Damage/LossRegardless of who is responsible, if a borrowed specimen is damaged or lost while in transit, during unpacking or packing, when being examined, measured, photographed, CT scanned, videotaped, or X-rayed, during installation or de-installation of a display, or while on display, the event must be reported immediately by telephone, fax or email to the CDHCS curator. If pieces of teeth or bone are broken off the specimen, every effort must be made to recover those pieces and return them safely to CDHCS along with the specimen. The researcher may not carry out repairs without the permission of the CDHCS curator. Should any incident occur regarding the borrowed specimen, whether or not damage is apparent, the event must be reported immediately and in writing to CDHCS.Examination/Mounting/Installation RestrictionsNo marker, pencil, pen, paint or other marks of any kind may be made on the specimens during measuring, photographing, scanning, videotaping, mounting or installing. No tape, museum wax, dental wax, glue, nails, screws, staples, wires or other materials may be placed on or into the specimens.Exhibit LabelsIf exhibited, the specimen label should include the following credit line: \"Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy, University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California\" accompanied by the specimen's catalogue number.Exhibit Publicity and ReproductionsWhile on display, specimens may be photographed for use within the exhibition space itself or for Condition reports. Permission for any other use, such as a publication, or printed or electronic promotional materials (i.e., posters, postcards, booklets, photographs, etc.), or items bearing those images (i.e., gift shop mugs, key chains, etc.), must be received in writing from CDHCS. If the researcher receives permission to make photographs for the purpose of an electronic or print publication or publicity, or item of merchandise, CDHCS requests one set of labeled photos and items for its archives. Photography by the general public is not allowed. Subjecting objects to any artificial or natural light beyond that agreed upon for display purposes requires separate permission from the CDHCS.Catalogue/Publication/Research FindingsIf a publication accompanies the exhibition or results from research, CDHCS requests two copies for its archives. CDHCS also requests copies of promotional materials that contain its specimens. If published, the specimen caption should include the following credit line: \"Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy, University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California\" accompanied by the specimen's catalogue number. A report of research findings must be provided to CDHCS at the conclusion of a loan made for research purposes regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.Loan ProcessLoan Approval Letter and Loan AgreementFollowing consideration of the initial loan request by the CDHCS curator, and approval by the museum chairperson and administration representative, the borrower and individual researcher they represent will be notified of the approval, in writing, and provided with an invoice for administrative fees and related costs, if any. An itemized list of specimen insurance values will be included within the letter. Once the borrower has complied with loan agreement conditions, and provided a memorandum and certificate of insurance, the loan agreement will be signed by all parties. Once the loan agreement form is signed, no additions to the specimen list are permitted.Loan FormIn addition to possible formal loan agreement documentation, on the day of the loan the researcher will sign an appropriate loan form that will contain, depending on which type of loan, some portion of the following information: specimen catalogue number(s); value of specimen(s); insuring party; researcher's name, phone number, affiliation and email address; brief description of the purpose of loan; proposed means of transport; anticipated date of return; age of each specimen; loaned condition of each specimen (see Loan Condition Report below); brief summaries of specimen care and handling guidelines, and acknowledgement of conditions governing loans. The loan form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Loan Condition ReportWhen the loan is processed, the CDHCS curator will record the skull condition within the faculty teaching/demonstration loan form, including damaged and/or missing areas of the skull and dentition, and congenital conditions. In signing the loan form, the instructor agrees that the borrowed specimens are received in the recorded condition.Loan Period and Renewal of LoanLoans are generally made for a maximum of six months. Requests for renewal must be made in writing to the curator and received 30 days before the expiration of the loan. The loan will be reviewed by the curator, museum committee, and administration representative if more than two renewal requests are submitted.Return of LoanThe researcher agrees to return the loan only to the CDHCS curator, by the date specified in the signed loan agreement, unless other arrangements are agreed to in advance by CDHCS.Loan FeesLoan Handling FeeResearch and exhibit loans are not subject to the administrative loan handling fee. Commercial use loans are subject to the administrative loan handling fee and will be charged a flat rate of $200 per specimen borrowed. This fee covers the cost of locating specimens, producing a loan condition report, processing forms, and packing, receiving and returning specimens to storage. Additional fees apply to commercial use loans that result in product development and distribution, as indicated in the Production of Images section.Loan Request Cancellation FeeOnce a formal loan request has been received from a non-UOP researcher, and review by CDHCS staff has begun, if the loan request is cancelled, withdrawn or postponed indefinitely by the researcher, a loan request cancellation fee of $50 will be charged to the borrower, whether the loan request was made on behalf of a prospective research project, exhibit or for commercial use. In addition, should the commercial use borrower cancel a loan request after a cost, such as the loan handling fee, has been incurred by CDHCS on behalf of the borrower, the borrower is responsible for that cost.InterpretationIn the event of any conflict between this agreement and any forms of the borrower, the terms of this agreement shall be controlling.Research Access to Skull CollectionsResearch RequestsThe Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy (Atkinson Collection) and P&S Comparative Anatomy collections are open to research by all qualified personnel. Access to the collections is by appointment only. Appointments are scheduled by the CDHCS curator upon receipt of a written statement of research objectives and data collection methods. (See links to research request forms at the top of this page.) All research requests should be emailed toCDHCScurator@pacific.eduon institutional letterhead addressed to:CDHCS CuratorUniversity of the PacificArthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry155 Fifth StreetSan Francisco, CA 94103A report of research findings must be provided to the CDHCS curator at the conclusion of a research study regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.University of the Pacific Faculty and Students, and Visiting ScholarsTo gain research access to the skull collections, please complete the appropriate Research Request application available at this site (see Forms), or request an application form from the CDHCS curator.Research Approval ProcessFor adequate review and scheduling, research requests must be submitted at least three months in advance by visiting scholars and one month in advance by dental school faculty and students. Proposed visit date(s) and study duration will be discussed at the time of research request submission to determine the feasibility of dates and times. Following consideration and approval of the research request by the CDHCS curator, the researcher will be notified of the approval in writing.Research ConditionsResearchersResearch permission is granted only to faculty and students of the University of the Pacific, to visiting scholars affiliated with academic institutions and to medical and dental professionals.Research Use FormOn the day of the visit, the researcher will sign a Research Use Form that contains the following information: Researcher's name, phone number, affiliation or professional address, email address, a brief description of conditions governing research use, and a list of specimens examined. The Research Use Form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Designated Research AreaResearch study of the skull collections by University of the Pacific faculty and students, and by visiting scholars must take place at the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry in the CDHCS's designated research area. Special permission must be obtained to transport specimens to nearby facilities, inside or outside the dental school, for photographing, X-raying or CT scanning.Specimen SelectionTo facilitate the sample selection process, an on-site Atkinson database is now available for use by researchers. Pre-selection of skulls using images and information in the database will minimize the visitor's need to survey the collection itself, an activity CDHCS discourages due to collection preservation concerns. If preferable, based on the objectives of the study and in consultation with the researcher, the CDHCS curator will select a specific or random sample of specimens from the skull collection.Care and PreservationThe curator will do most of the handling of the specimens, retrieving them from the storage cabinets for study and returning them after examination is completed. In this manner the potential for damage to the specimens is minimized. On the first day of the study, the researcher will be asked to read CDHCS's Procedural Advice for Handling Skulls guidelines and to sign a research form. There are no restrictions on the number of specimens available for study.Research FeesCurrently there are no research fees charged to students and faculty, or to visiting scholars.Teaching Access to Skull CollectionsTeaching Requests\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Off-Site or On-Site LocationThe P&S Comparative Anatomy Collection and a subset of specimens from the Atkinson Collection are available to University of the Pacific faculty for teaching and class demonstrations located either off-site within the dental school building or on-site in room 410, the CDHCS facility.

If it is after hours please call the same number (209.946.2315, extension 2) and leave a message. We will return your phone call within twobusinesshours.What kind of training does your staff have? Do you have students working at the counseling center?All members of our permanent staff (psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, and psychiatrist) have finished their degree programs. We also have two master's level clinicians on staff each year who are doctoral psychology interns. These clinicians come to us with considerable counseling experience, having finished all academic requirements for their doctoral programs from across the country. No undergraduate students work at CAPS.Do you have therapists who can work with people from varying backgrounds and cultures?Yes. Our therapists are trained to work with students from many cultures and backgrounds. We respect racial and cultural diversity.Do you have therapists who are familiar with sexual identity (including questioning) and gender identity concerns?Yes. Our therapists are trained to work with gay, lesbian, bisexual, gender variant, and questioning clients. Our therapists respect sexual and gender diversity and affirm gay, lesbian, bisexual, gender variant, and questioning individuals.How many students go to CAPS?Most years, we see about one in eight undergraduate and graduate students.What kinds of problems can I be seen for at CAPS?We help students with a variety of problems, ranging from homesickness to severe mental illness. For example, we see students with symptoms of anxiety and / or depression, we see couples with relationship difficulties, we see individuals with mental illnesses such as Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, and we see students who are adjusting to living away from home for the first time. These are all typical of the types of issues or concerns that we handle on a daily basis.Is there a limit to how long I can receive therapy at CAPS?Yes. Since we try to serve as many students as possible, in most cases we limit the number of sessions you can be seen each year. The therapy we offer is intended to be short-term (i.e., up to 5 sessions a semester) in most cases. If you think you want or need longer term therapy, you will need to discuss your therapy needs with your therapist.Is everything confidential? Can my parents or professors find out I've been to CAPS?The records at Counseling and Psychological Services are totally separate from the rest of your records at Pacific. For the most part, the fact that you have come to CAPS and what you discussed here is confidential and will not be revealed to anyone outside of CAPS. However, there are rare exceptions. For example, if you tell us that a child or someone over the age of 65 is being abused, we have to report that to the appropriate agency. If you tell us that you plan to seriously hurt yourself or someone else, we may have to intervene to ensure everyone's safety. We also sometimes work in conjunction with medical staff at Pacific Health Services and / or with the Student Victim Advocate. These exceptions are detailed in the Informed Consent statement you will be given during your first appointment. Additionally, the therapist you see will answer any further questions you have about exceptions to confidentiality.Is it true that you won't see some students? My friend said you wouldn't give him counseling and told him to see a private therapist.We will meet with any student for an initial assessment. There are circumstances in which the therapist determines that an individual's needs are beyond the scope of the services offered at CAPS. In these instances, we will offer a referral to other sources of help on or off campus.What if I need medication?CAPS has a part-time psychiatrist that is available 9 hours a week (Monday and Wednesday mornings, Tuesday afternoons) and works with students across our three campuses. Appointments to meet with our psychiatrist fill quickly, so we recommend scheduling an appointment as soon as possible in order to get your medication needs met.Appointments can be scheduled by calling 209.946.2315 x2 or completing ourappointment request formonline.I think I might have a problem with drinking or substance use.

You may utilize the emergency phones located throughout the campus for reporting emergencies. Finally, campus elevators are equipped with emergency phones that also connect to Public Safety.Stockton Campus - 209.946.3911Sacramento Campus - 916.739.7200San Francisco Campus - 415.929.6411Members of the University community are strongly encouraged to report all crimes and suspicious activity to their campus Department of Public Safety/Security or appropriate police agency in a prompt and timely manner.Why report an alleged incident?Alleged acts of bias, hate, discrimination, harassment and discriminatory harassment should be reported so the University can determine if any laws or policies have been violated and to support individuals who may have been victimized. Also, filing a report helps the University create a safe and welcoming campus climate that better supports everyone's ability to learn and/or work. If bias-related incidents go unreported, it makes it difficult for the University to appropriately address the issue, it diminishes campus climate, it may make some members of our community feel unsafe or unwelcome, or additional incidents may occur.What happens after a report has been filed?Because Pacific remains deeply committed to promoting and maintaining a civil community and maintaining a community that is respectful of all persons, the University will address all reported incidents that violate the student code of conduct, University policies and/or federal, state and local laws.An individual filing a report should know that once the University has received a report, the following steps typically occur:Confirmation that the report has been received will be communicated within 2 business days (should the individual(s) filing the report choose to include his/her name and contact information).Careful review of the details of the report to ensure that we have accurately understood the nature of the occurrence or violation.Conduct outreach to gather any additional relevant information that may be required in order determine what, if any, conduct, policy or legal violation has occurred:The process may include contacting individuals or groups who may have been involved in the occurrence as a bystander, a reporter or a respondent in order to obtain more information and/or it may include communicating with other appropriate campus officials, departments/offices or organizations.The University reserves the right to review incidents which may have occurred on and off campus when it involves a member of the Pacific community and depending upon the seriousness of the alleged conduct, policy or legal violation.Provide a safe setting for anyone involved in the incident to share information about what has occurred and as needed, make referrals to appropriate campus and community resources including the University's Victim's Advocate Program and the Counseling Center among others:Individuals will have an opportunity to learn what services are available to assist them as well as how to access and utilize those services.Determine an appropriate response to an occurrence, which may require assistance from appropriate campus offices or departments.In the case of students, the office of student conduct may be referred to.Matters involving University employees may be referred to Human Resources.Initiate appropriate outreach and education since the unfortunate occurrence of an incident may create specific educational opportunities for those connected to the incident through additional interventions:It provides the University with an opportunity to restate our commitment to Pacific's principles \"that diversity and inclusion are essential to the fulfillment of our institutional mission. We value inclusiveness in learning, curricular and co-curricular programming, campus climate, recruitment, admissions, hiring and retention.\"Depending upon the nature of the incident and the type of response that is required, key campus officials may initiate meetings with appropriate individuals or affinity groups to offer ongoing support, advocacy and/or updated information.Educating everyone, students, faculty, staff, alumni and our local community, about bias-related matters is important. Further, without breaching anyone's confidentiality or right to privacy, this may be an opportunity to develop curricular and co-curricular experiences that can be offered throughout the academic year that foster the advancement of diversity and inclusion.The Bias Response process is managed through the Senior Director of Culture and Belonging,\u00a0Rolly Kali-Rai,\u00a0who\u00a0may be contacted atrkalirai@pacific.edu.Will the campus community be notified of the outcome?It should be noted that to the extent that federal, state and local law as well as University policies permit, Pacific will keep appropriate individuals and groups apprised of the progress of an investigation and the final outcome on a \"need-to-know\" basis.To protect the privacy of all the individuals or groups involved, the University may not be able to release some of the details related to the incident; however, a summary report of all bias reporting, outcomes and findings will be used to proactively guide education and prevention efforts to foster culture and belonging.To remain compliant with the Clery Act, reported hate crimes will become a part of the mandatory documentation that is posted regularly with the Office of Public Safety's crime statistics.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

Here you will find information about:Cost and Financial AidThe public administration and public policy programs and the McGeorge School of LawCurriculum and RequirementsStudent LifeIf you have a question that isn't answered here,please contact us.Cost and Financial AidAre scholarships available?Each application to the MPA and MPP programs is automatically considered for scholarships. If accepted, the letter of admission will include details about the scholarship assistance McGeorge is able to offer. Most students receive a scholarship. Scholarship amounts are dependent on the strength of the application, the timing of the recruitment cycle, and other factors. For this reason, it is strongly encouraged that prospective applicants submit their application as early as possible to maximize the benefits which are available to them. Additionally, the McGeorge Financial Aid office is available to advise on Federal assistance programs, and other options available to graduate students.How much do the programs cost?Each semester, students pay tuition based on the number of units they are taking. Tuition for the 2023-24 academic year is $1,500 per unit, and students enroll in 4-12 units per semester. Fees for the Wellness Center and student activities range from $140 to $215 per semester. Finally, all students are required to have health insurance. If a student is not already covered under a health insurance plan, they will be required to purchase the student health insurance plan. Total tuition for the 36-unit MPA degree is $54,000 and for the 44-unit MPP degree is $66,000 before accounting for scholarships and other financial aid. Scholarships range from 10% to 50% of tuition.What financial aid is available?All students are considered for partial tuition scholarships when they apply. In addition, federal student loans and on-campus work-study jobs are available for qualified students who complete the FAFSA.Can federal loans be forgiven by public service?Some federal loans can be partially forgiven if employed in public service.Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF)Does McGeorge participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program for veterans?McGeorge is proud to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program.Information about Eligibility & BenefitsThe MPA/MPP Programs and the McGeorge School of LawDoes the American Bar Association accredit the MPP or MPA degrees?No, the ABA only accredits the JD degree at any law school, including McGeorge. The American Bar Association approved offering this degree through McGeorge School of Law by granting \"acquiescence\" In 2015. This allowed the MPA and MPP programs to be offered under the law school as well as allowing JD students to take public policy courses as electives.How does this program fit into law degrees at McGeorge?McGeorge School of Law offers the JD, MSL, LLM, and JSD law-related degrees and two non-law degrees \u2014 the MPP and MPA. The public policy and law degrees complement and strengthen each other. You will take at least two law courses among your required courses and more for an area of concentration. Law students may enroll in public policy courses and some students will pursue both a JD and MPP or JD and MPA degree.Is it possible to earn a JD degree as well as a MPP or a MPA?Through McGeorge\u2019s dual-degree program, you can earn both the JD and the MPP or MPA with just one more year of study in addition to that required for the JD, but saving a year compared to pursuing both degrees independently. Admission to the JD program requires a separate application, and admission into the MPA or MPP program does not guarantee admission into the dual-degree program for the JD.McGeorge\u2019s dual-degree programWhat is McGeorge\u2019s Influence in the Community?McGeorge School of Law has been educating lawyers in Sacramento since the 1920s. McGeorge alumni dominate lists of the 100 most influential attorneys in Sacramento and McGeorge alumni are leaders in state agencies, lobbying firms and non-profit organizations as well as law firms in Sacramento and beyond.Members of our McGeorge family serve on nonprofit boards, provide pro-bono legal services, and participate as active community volunteers for dozens of local and national community outreach organizations. Students, faculty, staff and alumni contribute thousands of hours annually to support important community and charitable efforts.Curriculum and RequirementsWhat are classes like?Our courses are typically comprised of 10-25 students. Classes are structured to allow for a working schedule, with most courses being offered in-person during the evenings or on weekends. While a few courses and individual class sessions are on-line, the vast majority of classes are taught in-person on our Sacramento campus.In PUB classes, students engage in spirited policy discussions and learn about innovative management approaches from experienced professionals. Most assignments take the form of recognized professional work products, such as a decision memo, an analysis to be presented to a committee of the California state legislature, an issue brief or comment on a proposed regulation. Some assignments are individual, while others are based on team work.Is a thesis required?No. Our Masters of Public Administration and Masters of Public Policy programs focus on practical professional skills. Instead of writing a thesis (a type of document you are unlikely to replicate later in your career) you'll participate in a capstone course. This capstone course requires students to construct a professional presentation on a major issue of public administration and/or policy by pulling together the knowledge and skills gained from all previous classes.How Should I choose between the MPA and the MPP?Are you most interested in working with others to implement public policies? Do you like partnering with or managing others in direct actions? If so, the MPA, which emphasizes leading and managing competencies, is a good choice. Are you most interested in analyzing how to solve complex public policy issues, including how to identify and assess options for action?

Summer classes may be required to complete the part-time program in four years. Students may also be able to accelerate the part-time program to three and one-half years by increasing their course load after the first year of study.Is it easier to be admitted to the Part-time Division than the Full-time Division?The admissions standards for the full-time and part-time programs are the same. In some cases, the undergraduate record is given different weight in relation to more recent employment or graduate work experiences since undergraduate work may have been completed many years ago. In addition, the admissions committee may offer full-time program applicants a seat in the part-time program if it is determined that the student may have better success in that program.Does McGeorge have an early decision or early admission deadline?No. However, we do have a priority deadline of Feb. 1.

Applicants are encouraged to reach out to college professors and administrators who have had the opportunity to assess their academic aptitude to write letters on their behalf.

We recommend you prepare for the LSAT and plan on taking it just once. If you are not satisfied with your score and think you can improve, you may want to consider retaking the LSAT. If you have multiple LSAT scores, with a five-point difference or greater, an LSAT disparity addendum is required with your application.Can I schedule an admissions interview at McGeorge?McGeorge does not offer interviews as part of the admissions process.

For more information on scholarships please visit ourfinancial aidandscholarshipweb pages.Although I have a strong G.P.A. for the last 60 units of my undergrad, I did poorly during my freshman year. Does this mean I won't get admitted?Grade trends such as this are evaluated often. Many students have uneven year-by-year undergraduate records. Evidence of overall academic strength is more important and, in general, superior performance in recent rigorous academic work is of significance, even if earlier grades were at a lower performance level. A short explanatory addendum to your personal statement is a good place to address such deficiencies.What factors does McGeorge consider when evaluating applications, and how are those factors weighed in the review process?The two largest components that are considered in predicting an applicant's relative success in law school are the grade point average and the LSAT score. Though these are useful predictors, they are not the only factors the admissions committee will consider when reviewing your application. McGeorge reviews each application in its entirety, considering every component. The admissions committee will take into consideration grade trends, leadership, volunteer and work experience, the personal statement, any addenda the applicant submits, and any information included in letters of recommendation. All components assist the admissions committee in determining an applicant\u2019s academic potential and propensity for success in law school.How much is JD tuition?Tuition (subject to Board of Regents approval) for the 2023-2024 academic year is $59,080 for the full-time program and $39,283 for the part-time program.We expect a 3% increase in tuition for the 2024-2025 academic year.\u00a0Please note that there are additional required fees and summer school is charged on a per unit basis;visit our tuition pagefor more information.How do I find out more about financial aid?For complete information on deadlines, options and the financial aid process, please visit thefinancial aid web page.

Dugoni School of Dentistry?A: No, all IDS applicants (first-time or returning) must submit a CAAPID application directly with the American Dental Education Association (ADEA).Q: I have previously submitted an application directly to the Dugoni School of Dentistry. Do I need to submit a CAAPID application?A: Yes, all returning applicants must submit a CAAPID application with American Dental Education Association (ADEA).Q: I applied last year and had to submit a PDF file of supplemental documents. Are these materials still required?A: No, all materials including transcripts, letters of recommendation, and test scores should all be sent through your CAAPID application. IDS Admissions will no longer accept duplicate or supplemental documents manually.Q: What happens when I submit my CAAPID application with ADEA on the deadline date?A: Applicants are highly encouraged not to wait until the deadline to submit their CAAPID application. Applicants who do apply on or near theADEA/CAAPID deadline\u2014Friday, June 9, 2023, 11:59 pm Eastern Time, must take full responsibility to fulfill ADEA's application requirements by filing an online CAAPID application, paying the processing fee, and providing all test scores, letters, and other documentation required prior to the deadline. It is also important to understand that ADEA may take more than 2 weeks before releasing the CAAPID application to Pacific, so the earlier you can submit your application, the better.Q: I see that I can still submit my CAAPID application to other programs, but I am not able to submit it to the Dugoni School. Is this normal after the application deadline?A: Yes, many programs using the CAAPID application service all have their own deadlines and processes. The Dugoni School of Dentistry has set their deadline for Friday, June 9, 2023, by 11:59 pm Eastern Time, though your CAAPID application will remain active until early February 2024. During this time, you may also submit your CAAPID applications to other programs. Our deadline is final, and no exceptions or extensions will be made. We always encourage applicants to be familiar with all dates and deadlines associated with other schools that they are planning to apply to.Important Note:The new ADEA Program Finder toolis now live (as of January 2023) for ADEA CAAPID programs! Check out this page for more information on programs you are looking into applying for this cycle.Q: I paid my supplemental application fee of $100 but was not able to submit my CAAPID application in time. Can I still be considered for admission?A: No. We are not able to review materials submitted without a valid and complete CAAPID application submitted by the deadline in June.Application FeeQ: Can I pay the application fee online with a credit card?A: Applicants will pay the $100 (USD \u2014 non-refundable) application fee online with a credit card (American Express, Discover, Mastercard or Visa). Please be sure to provide all requested payment information, including your CAAPID #.Q: Is the supplemental application fee different from the fees I already paid through CAAPID?A: Yes. You are required to pay all ADEA CAAPID fees associated with your application to each dental school. The Dugoni School\u2019s separate application fee of $100 can be paid through\u00a0the school's online payment portal.Q: I\u2019ve paid my $100 supplemental application fee but wasn\u2019t able to submit my CAAPID application. Is the application fee refundable?A: No, unfortunately there are no refunds given for the $100 fee. We recommend candidates wait until submitting their completed CAAPID application successfullybeforepaying the Dugoni School\u2019s $100 fee.Q: Do you accept fee waivers from the ADEA Fee Assistance Program?A: No, fee waivers only pertain to fees associated with ADEA. Our application fee is required for processing applications.Dental Curriculum Vitae (CV)Q: Do I need to copy the same format of the provided sample dental CV?A: We strongly recommend using the sample CV as a guide to ensure the admissions committee thoroughly reviews your experiences and accomplishments. Applicants should provide information about their dental experience from the time of earning their initial dental degree to present (unless noted otherwise). It is recommended that you replicate the sample CV and classify your dental experience by International and/or United States / Canada.Q: Can I submit updates to my dental CV after my CAAPID application is submitted?A: No, the IDS Admissions office will not be accepting any application updates after the CAAPID application is submitted. Make sure to submit your application with as much information on your file as possible, to ensure the admissions committee has all the information needed to make an informed decision regarding your application.Q: What if I do not have anything to include under one of the categorical heading options (i.e., I never received an advanced degree)?A: If you do not have any information to provide under a specific category, you can leave out that section header.Q: When I am logging my research experience, do I also log any associated publications I have completed with the research section, or do I also log publications in the section for publications (presentations, etc.).A: If you published any writing during your research experience, you would log your total research hours for each project in the research section AND log the publication you were a part of under the publications section.Q: How would I list conferences that I have attended on my dental CV?A: If you arepresentingat a conference, list the presentation itself under \u201cpresentations.\u201d If youattendedthe conference, this would likely go under Continuing Education, if CE credits were earned at this conference. If no CE credits were earned by attending the conference, do not include it on your CV.Q: Should I include any experiences, dental or non-dental related, from the time prior to receiving my initial dental degree?A: No, the committee will only score and consider experiences that are gained AFTER the receipt of your initial dental degree.Note:any internships, preceptorships, etc. that are part of your dental degree graduation requirements should not be included on the dental CV, as they are part of your degree requirements.Q: When I am listing my Continuing Dental Education (CDE) credits, do I list a summary of the hours, or should I list every course that I have taken?A: We prefer and recommend that applicants list ALL CDE related courses, both online and in-person on their dental CVs. Please make sure to still sort them by International CDE courses and US/Canada CDE courses, as with all section categories on your CV.Q: I have applied in a previous application year, and in the past I had to include all my other documents and files with my dental CV and send it as a PDF directly to admissions. Is this still required?A: No, we no longer ask for or accept additional files outside of the CAAPID application. There is a section on the CAAPID application, where you can upload additional files, including your Dental CV.Applications will not be considered complete without uploading your Dental CV.Letters of EvaluationQ: What if I have dental experience I\u2019d like to include in my application that was completed before my dental degree? Can I put it on my CV?A: The CV is geared towards getting information on experiences after dental school only (some sections allow items from during dental school). However, you will also be logging experiences directly on your CAAPID application. In the CAAPID experiences section, you may include any experiences gained prior to your dental degree in this area.Q: How many letters of recommendation are required for admission?A: Three letters are required, submitted through your ADEA CAAPID Application. Otherwise known as \u201cEvaluations,\u201d all three letters should be written in English (or translated to English by a certified translator) and should be as recent as possible written, signed, and dated no later than January 2020.Q: Who should I ask to write these letters for me?At least two of these three letters must be written by either U.S. or international dental professionals (dentists, dental school faculty, etc.) with whom you have worked or studied from. A letter from a dental school dean is not required.Q: What instructions should I give my evaluators to ensure that the letters are submitted properly?A: Please have your evaluators follow the following guidelines when submitting their letters:Provide the letter on company or school letterhead.Evaluators need to include theirname, phone number, email,andmailing addresseither directly on the letter or through the CAAPID submission process.Letters must be hand signed by the evaluator. Digitally signed letters will not be accepted.Q: When do the letters need to be submitted by?A: No later than the UOP Application Deadline in June. For the 2023-24 Application Cycle, the deadline to submit letters through ADEA CAAPID is Friday, June 9th, 2023, by 11:59 PM Eastern Time.Q: What if my evaluator sent in their letter to CAAPID without a physical signature or letterhead?A: If we find that a letter is missing a requirement such as a signature or letterhead while processing applications prior to the June application deadline, IDS Admissions will email the applicant with specific instructions and deadlines to have the evaluator correct the error, and to re-send the letter to us directly atids@pacific.edu. Only letters of correction requested by the Office of Admissions will be accepted outside the ADEA CAAPID application. Failure to correct errors in a timely manner can cause your file to be incomplete after the June deadline passes.Q: Do I need to submit letters of evaluation to the Dugoni School of Dentistry when I already submitted them to ADEA CAAPID?A: No, ADEA CAAPID will ask for up to three letters when you are completing your application. Please submit your evaluations that we require through ADEA CAAPID as instructed on your application.Q: To whom should the letters of evaluation be addressed?A: The letters of evaluation should be addressed to the IDS Admissions Committee.Q: May I submit more than 3 letters of evaluation to Pacific?A: No. We will not accept additional letters of recommendation past the three required by ADEA CAAPID. Additional letters sent to us directly will not be considered for your application.Q: What happens if my letter is not written in English?A: Applicants will be required to provide the letter in its original language along with an English translation from a certified translator.National Board Dental Examination (NBDE1&2 or INBDE)Q: Can I apply to the IDS program now and take the NBDE 1&2 or INBDE later?A: No, applicants must take and pass NBDE 1&2 or INBDE by application deadline and request ADA Department of Testing Services to submit results to ADEA.Q: Will my application be considered with a NBDE score of 74 (just one point from 75) or a Fail result to NBDE or INBDE?A: No, applicants who earned a score less than 75 or a Fail result, are encouraged to retake the NBDE 1&2 or INBDE to earn a Pass result; otherwise, the application will be considered incomplete and will not be reviewed by the IDS Admissions Committee.Q: Does the Admissions Committee consider the number of attempts when reviewing these submissions?A: The IDS Admissions Committee evaluates applications holistically, so the number of attempts would not disqualify an applicant from applying to our program.Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)Q: Am I required to take the TOEFL?A: Yes, all applicants, including U.S. citizens, are required to take the TOEFL. Request ETS to provide the TOEFL score report to ADEA (institution code \u2013 B451) with scores earned between January 2021 to present. An internet-based test (iBT) total score of 92 or higher is required.Q: Am I exempt from taking the TOEFL when I have earned a degree from a U.S. college/university that did not require me to take a TOEFL since my English is good/proficient?A: There are no exemptions. All applicants are required to take the TOEFL.Q: Can I apply to the IDS program now and take the TOEFL later?A: No, it is recommended to wait for the TOEFL result\u00a0before sending the PDF email attachment with all the supplemental documents.Q: Will my application be considered with a TOEFL internet-based test (iBT) total score of 91?A: No, applicants who earned less than the iBT total score of 92 are encouraged to retake the TOEFL; otherwise, the application will be considered incomplete and will not be reviewed by the IDS Admissions Committee.Q: Do you accept MyBest scores?A: No, MyBest scores will not be considered. IDS Admissions will only accept TOEFL scores from a single test date.Q: I have taken the TOEFL exam more than once. How does the IDS Admissions Committee consider multiple TOEFL scores?A: We do not have a limit on the number of TOEFL attempts taken. However, the Admissions Committee will only considerthe most recent score. I.e., if you get a lower score when you retake the TOEFL, the Admissions Committee will consider that new score, and the higher first score will be voided.Q: Will you accept TOEFL retakes that are taken after application submission?A: Yes if we receive the TOEFL scores before the June deadline. We will include the new scores for the committee\u2019s review. After the deadline, we will not consider the new TOEFL scores.Dental Diploma/CertificateQ: Can I apply with a medical degree?A: Only applicants who have earned a dental degree (BDS, DDS, DMD, Odontology, Stomatology) are eligible to apply to the IDS program.Q: Can I apply with a provisional dental degree?A: IDS Admissions do not accept provisional dental degrees nor offer any exceptions to this dental degree requirement. Applicants are required to submit a scanned version of the dental diploma/certificate to be included in the uploaded documents section of their CAAPID application.Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE)Q: What grade average will be considered?A: A U.S. grade average of 2.00 \u2013 4.00 is required. Applicants with a grade average of 0 \u2013 1.99 will not be eligible to apply to the IDS program.Q: Do you accept any other agency\u2019s evaluations?A: IDS Admissions will only accept ECE course-by-course evaluation with a U.S. grade average of 2.00 \u2013 4.00.Q: What if I discover an error was made on my grade average calculation?A: Corrected grade average from the ECE course-by-course evaluations will be considered as long as they are received by us before the June deadline. If ECE provides an additional grade average score (i.e., best result or comprehensive), Pacific will only consider thecomprehensive grade average.Financial Aid/ScholarshipsQ: As an international student, am I eligible to apply for federal financial aid?A: This depends on your current citizenship/visa status. Only students who are U.S. citizens, U.S. permanent residents or eligible non-citizens are eligible to apply for federal financial aid.Q: Does the Dugoni School of Dentistry provide any kind of scholarships for the applicants?A: The Dugoni School of Dentistry has limited institutional scholarships; however, there is no guarantee of receipt of these funds. Students accepted to the IDS program will receive a consultation appointment from the Financial Aid office prior to matriculation to discuss the cost of attendance and financing their dental education.IDS Admissions RequirementsIDS Program: How and When to ApplyFrequently Asked QuestionsContact the Admissions OfficeContact IDS AdmissionsUniversity of the Pacific, Arthur A.

If your scores are significantly lower than our class averages (below 20), we recommend retaking the Dental Admissions Test (DAT). There is not a deadline to take the DAT, but preference for admission is given to students who provide final DAT scores no later than November for any given admissions cycle. The committee reviews only the most recent DAT scores provided.For instructions on how to schedule a date for the DAT, please visit theAmerican Dental Association (ADA)website.Q: Are there particular courses that would best prepare me for dental school?A: The Admissions Committee encourages every student to develop his or her course of study in conjunction with the college or university predental advisor. If a school does not have a predental advisor, the student should consult faculty members in the chemistry and biology departments to select courses that meet the intent of the predental requirements. We recommend you select courses that extend the content of biomedical sciences, such as anatomy, histology, biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology.Q: What level of performance is the Admissions Committee looking for in my academic history?A: Many of our successful applicants completed three or more terms of full-time study at a college within the last three years. Full-time study is defined as four or more courses per term. In each term, three of the four courses should be predental science courses approved for biology majors. Applicants should achieve a B or better in each course; no D, W, F or I grades. Our incoming class grade point averages (GPA) are 3.6 overall and 3.5 science.Q: Are there elective courses that would help prepare me to be a good dentist?A: To develop your doctor/patient relationship skills, we recommend a course in journalism, public speaking, debate, interpersonal relationships, or drama.To prepare you for managing your own business, we recommend accounting for small business, marketing for the small business, consumer behavior or economics courses.To enhance your hand skills, we recommend course work in mechanical drafting/drawing, jewelry making, sculpting or ceramics.Q: Does Pacific require a secondary application?A: No. You need only to file anAssociated American Dental School Application Service (AADSAS)application.

The official deadline is early February.Q: How will your Admissions Office notify me regarding the status of my application?A:\u00a0To find out the most up-to-date status of your application,Applicants selected by our Executive Admissions Committee are invited to the dental school for an interview. Invitations for interview are extended by phone and confirmed by email. Most of our interviews are conducted from September through March. By May, all applicants will be notified by mail as to the final decision on their application.Q: What are the selection factors for an interview at Pacific?A: The Admissions Committee carefully considers each applicant's scholastic record, scores on the DAT, AADSAS essay, letters of evaluation, evidence of manual dexterity (including the perceptual ability portion of the DAT) and other personal attributes and qualities as well as demonstration of his or her understanding about a career in the dental profession.Applicants who appear to meet the requirements will be invited to the dental school in San Francisco for an interview with one or more members of the Admissions Committee. During the interview the applicant's interest in dentistry, future plans, maturity and other personal qualities needed for successful work with patients are assessed. In addition, applicants will participate in an orientation seminar, meet informally with current dental students and tour the school. Applicants who are offered the opportunity to enroll must complete planned coursework at a specified performance level.The Executive Admissions Committee reserves the right to override admissions recommendations made by faculty interviewers.Q: If I have applied to your dental school in previous years, am I guaranteed admission next year?A: No. Our dental school has one of the largest applicant pools in the country. This year more than 2,700 individuals applied for 140 positions.Unfortunately, the Admissions Committee had to deny admission to many qualified applicants due to limited class size. Competitive applicants may need to apply several times before being invited for an interview.Indicating your re-applicant status on your next application willnotnegatively impact your admissions status for the new cycle.Q: My AADSAS status says that my application is \u201cReceived/Waiting Additional Information.\u201d What does this mean and what are the next steps?A: In order to have a complete application, we must receive the following items, in addition to the successful submission of yourAADSAS Application:FINAL Dental Admissions Test (DAT) ScoresThree Letters of Recommendation (two from science professors, one of your choice) OR a committee letter$75 Supplemental Application FeeWe do not accept fee waivers for the supplemental fee.The Fee portal will close on the specifiedADEA AADSAS Deadlineeach year, so if you do not submit your payment to us before that deadline, we will not be able to review your application for that cycle.Make sure to regularly check your emails after submitting your application for updates to ensure all files are submitted.

During the on-campus events, attendees are given a tour of the program facilities. Campus tours are offered during admission interviews.Due to the high volume of applicants, we are unable to offer unscheduled campus tours. See our full listing ofupcoming events.Do you offer one-on-one advising sessions/transcript review sessions?Unfortunately, due to the volume of applicants, and in order to ensure fairness in the evaluation of applicants, we are unable to meet individually with applicants.

However, it does strengthen your application if there is some recent coursework.My bachelor\u2019s degree will not be completed until after the admissions cycle closes. However, I have completed all other prerequisites. Can I still apply?No. In order to meet all prerequisites, your degree must be awarded and appear on an official transcript at the time of application submission.Do I need to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE)?The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is not required, but applicants can elect to submit their scores at the time of testing using the designated institution (DI) code 7363. If you have previously taken the GRE and would like to submit your scores, University of the Pacific\u2019s GRE code is 4065. Scores are valid for 5 years perETSwebsite.How do you calculate my GPA?We use CASPA calculated GPAs, specifically the Overall Total GPA and Overall Science GPA. We will not recalculate GPAs for admissions purposes. It is therefore very important that all grades have posted and appear on your transcript prior to submitting your application.Learn more about how CASPA calculates GPAs.Are pass/fail courses acceptable for prerequisite courses?Pass/fail courses are acceptable to meet prerequisite courses if taken at an accredited US institution.

Note: AP/CLEP credits cannot be used to meet science prerequisites.If AP credits are lumped together on your transcript without course credit equivalencies (i.e. AP credits \u2013 12.0), please request a letter of explanation for AP credits from your university\u2019s Registrar. Once obtained, please upload the letter to CASPA to accompany your application materials. The letter must be on university letterhead or bear the seal of the institution.I have vertebrate (or another type of) anatomy. Will that satisfy the Human Anatomy requirement?No, we require Human Anatomy to satisfy the Human Anatomy prerequisite requirement.I have one composition class and one literature class. Do I need to take another composition class to satisfy the English requirement?No. As long as you have successfully completed at least one composition course, we will accept a literature, writing-intensive, or composition course to complete the requirement. AP/CLEP credit (if recorded on a transcript) may also be used to fulfill the English requirement.I am an international medical graduate. Which services do you accept for academic evaluation?We will only accept the World Education Services (WES) evaluation of foreign training. CASPA will also accept the WES evaluation of transcripts so this is the required service for our program. For more information visitwww.wes.org.Is the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) required? If so, what is the cut-off score?Please consult theTOEFL flowchart. The TOEFL cut off score is 100. TOEFL scores are valid for two years after the test date perETSwebsite. IELTS scores can be substituted for the TOEFL exam with a cut-off score of 7.0.CASPA allows up to 5 letters of recommendation, but your program only requires 2. If I submit 5, will they all be considered, or will you pick only 2 to read?Our admissions committee considers the letters of recommendation as a whole, so if you have more than 2, they will all be considered. It is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage to your application if you have more than the 2 required letters.Health Care ExperienceWhat type of health care experience will satisfy the health care experience requirement?We do not consider one type of clinical experience greater than another (i.e. experience as an RN is not more valued than that of a medical assistant). Experience may be paid or unpaid. We do not accept hours accrued for academic credit or as part of a training or experiential learning course/program.Examples of experiences that typically satisfy the HCE requirement:Athletic TrainerCertified Nursing Assistant (CNA)* Must be licensed.ChiropractorChiropractor AssistantDental HygienistDieticianEKG/EEG TechnicianEmergency Medical Technician (Basic or Intermediate)Emergency Room TechnicianMedical Assistant (Back Office)Medical ScribeMilitary Medic or CorpsmanNurseOccupational TherapistOccupational Therapy Assistant or AideOphthalmic/Optometric Assistant / TechnicianParamedicPharmacistPhlebotomistPhysical TherapistPhysical Therapy Aide/Tech/AssistantRadiological TechnicianRehabilitation TechnicianRespiratory TherapistSurgical Technician / AssistantUltrasound TechnicianExamples of experiences that typically do not satisfy the HCE requirement:Basic Caregivers & CompanionsBehavioral Health TechniciansBilling / InsuranceCaring for family membersCase Management, Records ManagementClinical Care ExtenderDietary Aide / ClerkGreeterHealth EducatorsLifeguardingMedical Translation / InterpretingMedical Transcription / Virtual ScribePatient NavigatorPatient TransporterPersonal TrainersPharmacy Clerks (Retail)ShadowingVeterinary care or other experiences working with animalsExperiences mainly administrative in natureAny experience accrued for academic credit or as part of a training or experiential learning course/programAt a minimum, the applicant's clinical experience should include one of the following:Collecting of, and/or reporting in the patient's chart, data necessary to establish a diagnosis or evaluate the progress of the patient's treatment plan;Assisting a health care worker in the performance of diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures;Under the supervision of a health care provider administering or dispensing medications;Other work involving direct patient contact and interaction.HCE credit is determined by the duties you performed, not solely by job title. It is imperative when completing your application to include a detailed description of your job duties to ensure the Admissions Team can accurately determine HCE applicability.If you are not sure if your experience will satisfy the requirement please contact the program atPAprogram@pacific.edufor further clarification.Should I still apply if I won\u2019t have 1,000 hours by the application deadline?The program requires a minimum of 1,000 hours of health care experience (accrued at the time of application). If you will not be able to accumulate at least 1,000 hours of health care experience by the deadline, then you should wait to apply during a future cycle. The program does not project hours up to our application deadline or matriculation, but rather considers the number of hours accrued at the time you submit your application.Application Submission & CASPAI made a mistake/omission on my application. I have now fixed the issue. Can you re-evaluate my application with the new information?Unfortunately, we use the CASPA application, as submitted and verified, to make admission decisions. We know the application is a snapshot in time, however, we must have stability in applications to make an \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison between applicants. Accordingly, we will not accept any changes to submitted and verified CASPA applications within a given application cycle. Thus, it is imperative that applicants review their applications thoroughly prior to submission.Can I submit supplemental application materials to the program?We do not have a supplemental application. Please do not submit documents directly to the program unless requested. We use the Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) program to keep all of your application documents in one secure online location. We encourage you to make sure to include all pertinent information in your initial CASPA application, as it is sometimes difficult to add documents later.My grades have now posted for courses that were in progress when I submitted my CASPA application. Can you recalculate my GPA?We use CASPA-calculated GPAs, specifically the Overall Total GPA and Overall Science GPA. We will not recalculate GPAs for admissions purposes. It is therefore very important that all grades have posted and appear on your transcript prior to submitting your application.All applicants who are offered a seat in the class will have their GPAs verified prior to matriculation to ensure that any non-prerequisite, in-progress courses, maintained a GPA, in both overall total and overall science calculations, above the required 3.0.Learn more about how CASPA calculates GPAs.Can I use CASPA\u2019s professional transcript entry service for my coursework?Yes. Please keep in mind that the professional transcript entry service requires additional time once you have submitted your application. If you utilize the service, plan to submit your application early enough to allow for the extra steps to be verified by our deadlines. \u00a0For more information about professional transcript entry, please refer to theCASPA Help Center.What is your timeline for reviewing applications, interviewing candidates, and selecting a class?We will review each application once it has been verified by CASPA and delivered to our program. CASPA states that the average application is verified within 2 weeks. Until it is verified by CASPA, our program is unable to provide you with any information regarding the status of your application. Upon CASPA verification, your application will undergo a complete, holistic review, beginning with verification of prerequisite completion. The application review process can take several weeks; however, it is not uncommon to receive a response within a few days.Qualified applicants will be invited to interview for a position in our program. Interview invitations are extended throughout the admissions cycle at a rate determined by the quality of our applicant pool each year. Interviews take place from July through September, with our final class selection taking place no later than Oct 1.What is the application submission deadline? Do my transcripts need to be verified by CASPA by the deadline?Applications must be submitted and in \u201ccomplete\u201d status by 11:59 p.m. EST ( 8:59 p.m. PST) on Aug. 1. A complete date is given when an application is e-submitted and all transcripts, payments, and at least two letters of reference have been received by CASPA and attached to the application. Note: CASPA states that the average application will be verified within 2 weeks. It is up to the applicant to ensure that their application materials are submitted in a correct and timely manner so that the application can quickly move through the verification process. Exceptions are not granted, so be sure to plan ahead to meet the posted deadlines.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bI have substantial volunteer hours that I completed in high school. Should I include these hours in my application?We only review volunteer hours earned post-high school. Please do not include hours earned during or before high school.InterviewsDo you have rolling admissions or offer early acceptance?All seats will be offered after the final interviews have been conducted. Due to our admissions timelines and in fairness to all applicants, we do not offer early admission.I was invited for an interview. What will the format of the interview day look like?The interview day lasts several hours and consists of an orientation, panel interview, and group interview. Tours of the program facilities and campus are included.I was invited for an interview. Can I bring updated materials (r\u00e9sum\u00e9, transcripts, letters of recommendation, etc.) to the interview?We use the Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) program to keep all of your application documents in one secure online location. We will not accept any documents on the interview day. Please do not submit documents directly to the program unless requested.I received a notification that I will not be offered a seat in the class this cycle. What can I do to improve my application for the next cycle?With more than 2,500 applicants for 45 seats, the applicant pool is deep and competitive and most programs do not have the time or staffing to give applicants who did not meet their criteria feedback about how to improve their application. We do not offer specific advice for applicants; however, if you look at the average matriculant to PA school in 2019, you can get an idea of what a competitive applicant looks like. The average matriculant had a BS degree in biology or health sciences, a GPA of 3.58, 3,240 hours of health care experience involving direct patient care, and variable volunteer work. (PAEA, 2019). Every program has certain things they are looking for, so there is not any solitary thing to focus on, but you will want to be competitive with those that are matriculating and pay attention to the program mission. You may also want to consult our matriculant data on thePA Program Datapage.Is there an alternate list for acceptance?With a robust and highly competitive applicant pool, we cannot accept every qualified applicant.

However, you must have pre-requisites completed ten weeks prior to the start of class.Back to topDo all prerequisites have to be completed within a specific time frame?No, but it is desired that all prerequisite courses (in particular, the human anatomy and human physiology prerequisites) have been completed within the past seven years of your application date.Back to topCan the prerequisite communication courses be substituted?No, these are requirements set by the Board of Registered Nursing and are verified when ELMSN graduates submit their documentation for licensing exam eligibility. Only courses titled Group Communication, Verbal Communication, Written Communication or closely related titles will be accepted. It is not enough for a course to have an \u201cextensive writing or communication component\u201d or be too specific in one form of writing. All applicants, regardless of their academic or professional background, must complete each of the prerequisites to be considered for admission to the program.Back to topCan one course satisfy multiple prerequisites?No, each course may only satisfy one prerequisite.Back to topHow can an applicant fulfill the Human Development Across the Lifespan course requirement?The course may be offered through a human development or psychology department but must touch upon human development from birth until death. This course requirement can be fulfilled by a series of courses which combined are worth at least three semester units.Back to topIs there a certain grade requirement for the prerequisite courses?Yes, applicants must receive a cumulative GPA of3.2or better in all prerequisite coursework. It is best practice to have a B or better in all nursing prerequisites.Back to topCan prerequisites be waived?No, applicants must complete all prerequisites, regardless of their prior academic or professional backgrounds.Back to topIs AP Credit Accepted?No, we do not accept AP credit in place for prerequisite coursework.GeneralWhat degree will I earn?Master of Science in Nursing (MSN).Back to topHow long is the program?Full time for 24 months and 90 units (six consecutive semesters). The program averages 15 to 16 units per semester.Back to topWhen does the program begin?The ELMSN program admits 40 students twice a year. Admitted students begin in August or January. Applicants must submit their applications approximately eight months in advance.Back to topCan I apply if I want to be a family nurse practitioner but I am not a registered nurse?Prospective students first need to be a registered nurse before applying to a family nurse practitioner program. One option is to complete a Master\u2019s Entry Program in Nursing. Graduates are eligible to apply to a Post-MSN family nurse practitioner certificate program upon licensure or apply to a DNP FNP program.Back to topDoes the ELMSN prepare students to become a licensed registered nurse?Yes, the program provides California Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) approved coursework and clinical experiences needed in preparation for the National Council Licensing Examination (NCLEX) to practice as a registered nurse. Upon completion of the entire ELMSN program, students are eligible to take the NCLEX exam to become licensed registered nurses.Back to topWhat is the difference between the Bachelor of Science in Nursing and the Master\u2019s Entry Program in Nursing (ELMSN)?The Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree is an undergraduate program that allows students to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree as they prepare to become registered nurses. The ELMSN is a graduate program designed for individuals who already earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in a different field and seek to transition into clinical nursing and leadership roles.Back to topWhat is the difference between MSN and ELMSN?Both programs are graduate nursing programs, however, MSN is designed for students who already earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in Nursing and seek to further their nursing education. ELMSN is designed for individuals with a bachelor\u2019s degree in another discipline who seek to transition into nursing.Back to topHow is ELMSN program unique?The curriculum incorporates the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (2021) New Educational Standards (Domains). As healthcare is shifting to a community-based model, students will complete coursework in epidemiology, population health, advanced pharmacology and a Public Health Certificate coursework. In addition, the program curriculum was based on best practices as identified through nursing education research. Some of the highlights of this approach are case-based, problem-based learning, and simulation. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, ELMSN graduates are in the highest demand of all nursing programs and earn the highest salaries upon graduation. Also, California employment data (2019) of nursing graduates demonstrated a preference by employers for the ELMSN graduates.Back to topApplication informationStudents applying to ELMSN must complete a\u202fNursingCAS\u202fapplication and meet selection criteria. Following that process, qualified applicants who are verified by NursingCAS will be eligible for an interview conducted online or in person.How often are applications accepted?We accept applications twice a year for an August or January start.Back to topHow does one distinguish her or himself as a strong applicant?Given the competitive applicant pool, we recommend that each applicant submits a thorough and complete application prior to the deadline. Applicants' ability to articulate why they would like to become a nurse weighs heavily in the evaluation process. This should be clearly communicated in the essay.Back to topHow many letters of recommendation are required and from whom? Can letters of recommendation be sent directly to the school?We require three letters of recommendation. Please use recommenders who can speak to your academic performance, or your professional performance (e.g., faculty, employers). Hard copies are not accepted. Instead, submit your letters of recommendation through NursingCAS (PDF, Word document or by pasting text). References should be current within the last two years and should describe the applicant\u2019s strengths and potential as well as any concerns for completing the program and moving forward with a successful career in nursing.Back to topWhat should be included in the essays?The essays provide an opportunity to describe the applicant\u2019s reasons for pursuing a master's degree and for choosing the graduate nursing program at University of Pacific. The prompt will be posted in the NursingCAS application.Back to topDo I need experience in the healthcare field? Is experience preferred?No, it is not necessary to obtain acceptance into the ELMSN program. This program is designed for people without experience in healthcare. The admissions committee finds that students with degrees in other disciplines are often transferable to nursing. While experience is not required, exposure to professional healthcare and the ability to discuss your understanding of the RN role will strengthen your application.Back to topHow do I pay my application fee?All application fees require payments by credit card. Only cards with Visa and Master Card logos will be accepted. No checks, money orders or cash will be accepted.Back to topWhat if I do not have a Visa or Master Card?Payment may be made with a Visa or Master Card prepaid gift card which can be purchased at many major chain stores or online. Please be aware that the gift card must contain a balance sufficient to cover the application fee in one full payment.Back to topIMPORTANT:Your application and materials must have a \u201ccomplete\u201d (all materials received and pending verification) or \u201cverified\u201d status by the deadline. It is the applicants' responsibility to monitor the status of their applications and application materials on a regular basis. NursingCAS does NOT notify applicants if applications are incomplete or if documents are missing. Only applications and application materials with a \"complete\" or \"verified\" status by the deadline are considered for admission. For more information on application status, please visit the NursingCAS\u2019 Applicant Help Center.GPAWhat is the minimum GPA requirement?The minimum overall bachelor\u2019s degree GPA requirement is 3.0anda 3.2 in the last 60 units. The minimum nursing overall prerequisite GPA requirement is 3.2.Back to topHow do you calculate an applicant\u2019s bachelor\u2019s degree GPA? Do you use the NursingCAS calculation?We use the overall GPA fromallcollege coursework calculated by NursingCAS based on the coursework reported by the applicant and verified with transcripts by NursingCAS.Back to topIf my overall GPA is below a 3.0 or my nursing prerequisite GPA is below a 3.2, am I still eligible to apply?No, all applicants must meet the minimum GPA requirements listed on the website.Back to topCan I retake classes to improve my GPA?An applicant\u2019s overall bachelor\u2019s degree GPA is final upon graduation. Taking additional courses or repeating courses after receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree does not affect a bachelor\u2019s degree GPA. However, Nursing prerequisite courses completed or repeated after graduation are calculated into the overall, last 60 unit, and nursing perquisite GPA.Back to topHow will repeated courses be calculated into my GPA?If the course was repeated at the degree-granting institution prior to graduation, the GPA calculation is determined by the school\u2019s grade-forgiveness policy.\u00a0Repeated prerequisites will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.Back to topWhat courses are used to calculate the prerequisite science GPA?Human Anatomy with lab (4 units), Human Physiology with lab (4 units), Microbiology or Bacteriology with lab (4 units), Statistics or Epidemiology (3 units), Nutrition (3 units), Sociology or Social Science (3 units), Communication (total 6 units), written and oral communication, and Psychology are all used to calculate your nursing prerequisite GPA.Back to topDoes the School of Nursing look at the entire undergraduate transcript or just the last 60 units of the undergraduate GPA?All college coursework is reviewed and calculated for an overall GPA. We also review and calculate the last 60 units.Back to topTime commitment and class scheduleCan students in the ELMSN program be part-time?No, this program requires a full-time commitment.Back to topWhere will the classes take place?Classes take place at the School of Health Sciences on Pacific\u2019s Sacramento campus.Back to topCan students work while enrolled in ELMSN?Be advised that the program requires a very intensive, full-time commitment from students. It is strongly recommended that you do not work or entertain other commitments outside of the program while enrolled.Back to topHow often are students in class during the program?Students can expect to be on campus full-time for the duration of the program in preparation for licensure. Most courses are held Monday through Friday, however, some courses and clinical experiences are held in the evenings or on weekends. For clinical rotations, students\u2019 often complete clinical rotations one to two days a week. In the final semester of the program, students will complete a precepted immersion experience, which requires you to be available Monday to Sunday to work two 12-hour shifts aligned with the assigned preceptor\u2019s schedule. This can include weekends and nights.Back to topWhat are the clinical experiences like?Clinical placements take place every semester for about 15-24 hours per week. Students complete clinical experiences in acute and ambulatory care, home and community. Students also participate in simulations (including high- and mid-fidelity patient simulators, standardized patients, task trainers and computer simulations) and are required to have reliable transportation to travel up to 50 miles for select rotations.Back to topBack to Nursing ProgramStockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

This program is being phased in over the course of three years, beginning with the class of 2016, students are required to complete (a.) either an Externship or Legal Clinic (3 units minimum), and (b.) a minimum of 8 units of simulation and practicum courses, including at least one simulation course and at least one practicum course.What is a Clinic or Externship?Through the Externship Program and Legal Clinics, students can get hands-on legal experience, putting the theory. They put the theory learned in the classroom into practice in an on-campus or hybrid clinic, or a field placement in a government agency or non-profit setting. Students in the on campus clinics represent real clients under careful supervision and all clinical and field placement students gain real-world legal skills.What is a Simulation Course?Simulation Courses (formerly referred to as Experiential Courses) are courses where students learn by doing, and in which the vast majority of instruction is devoted to professional skills and values required of practicing lawyers. Such courses enable students to integrate legal theory, professional skills, and professional identity.What is a Practicum Course?Practicum Courses are courses in which at least one-third of instruction is devoted to a professional skill or set of professional skills characteristically used by practicing lawyers. Practicum courses give students the opportunity to learn substantive law and also learn and appreciate the context in which that law is to be applied by working on lawyer-like projects on simulated legal matters.How will I know which courses qualify?By their very nature, these courses tend to be dynamic, cutting-edge offerings. From year-to-year the list of qualifying courses will change to reflect legal trends and interesting opportunities for McGeorge students. For example, in Spring 2014, we were able to offer a Practice Skills for Eminent Domain Lawyers simulation class taught by a partner from Downey Brand, in collaboration with the City of Sacramento. Each year, a list of qualifying courses is published online on theOffice of the Registrar page.May I take extra experiential courses?Space permitting, yes. Some students select both a clinic and a field placement and several practicums and simulations! Students report that the courses in the Experiential Curriculum prepare them well for the practice of law.What if I cannot meet the Clinic/Externship Requirement because of my job?Students who work full time (approximately 40 hours/wk) during normal business hours may request a waiver of the Externship/Legal Clinic portion of the Experiential Curriculum. Waiver requests will be reviewed by the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs or the Associate Dean and granted for good cause only. Waiver forms are available at the Office of the Registrar or the Office of Student Affairs.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

With so many businesses and industries being impacted by constantly changing laws and regulations, having knowledge and training in legal analysis can be advantageous in dealing with those everyday law-related issues.What can I do with an MSL degree?Because the law intersects with every industry in one way or another, it is very likely there is some aspect of your current role that could be enhanced with a MSL degree. Our MSL degree can also open career opportunities by allowing you to pivot your career toward the legal aspects of your field. For example, someone working in government affairs may take courses in lobbying, election law, and statutory interpretation. Individuals working with water and environmental issues may take courses in water resources law, environmental law, and water and environmental justice.Through our MSL coursework, you'll be better equipped to:Review and understand agreements such as contractsReview and draft proposed local, state, and federal laws and regulationsUnderstand and comply with regulatory requirements for specific industriesWork with attorneys and compliance officersWhat can I expect in terms of workload?Typical students will take six units in each semester. The general rule of thumb is that for every hour you spend in the \u201cclassroom,\u201d you can expect another 1.5 \u2013 3 hours of additional studying.How many courses must I complete in order to earn an MSL degree?Students must complete 26 credits. Please refer to the program\u2019s curriculum web page for a complete list of required and elective courses.Who teaches the classes?The classes are taught by a combination of McGeorge\u2019s full-time faculty members and highly qualified adjunct instructors. Many of the adjunct instructors are practitioners in the fields of water law and environmental law. We encourage you to view the faculty bios and send us an email atgraduatelaw@pacific.eduif you would like to connect with a McGeorge professor.What is required as part of the application?An application containing the following items is required: Official transcripts for all universities and colleges that you have attended, a resume or curriculum vitae, a personal statement, a writing sample, and one (required) or two (preferred) letters of recommendation. For more information, see MSL Admission.How are admissions decisions communicated to applicants?All decisions will be communicated to applicants via email. If you are admitted, a formal letter will be attached to the email.If I am accepted, how much time will I have to decide whether to enroll or not?Applications are accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis with a commitment required by April 1 (Fall start) or Nov. 1 (Spring start). The sooner you apply, the longer span of time you will have to make a decision that will work best for you. If an applicant submits their application materials after these dates, they will have two weeks from the time a decision is rendered to pay a seat deposit and commit to the program. Extensions to this two-week rule may be granted on a case-by-case basis.Is financial aid available?Yes, students may be eligible for financial aid.

McGeorge is a 100% Yellow Ribbon matching institution.Is it possible for my employer to cover all or part of the tuition?Applicants should check with their individual employers. Of the companies that do assist with tuition payments, some have a limit on the amount of tuition that can be covered in any given year. We encourage you to reach out to your Human Resources department to see if this benefit is available to you.When do classes begin?Students may begin the online program in either the Fall (August) or Spring (January) semester. The exact date that the academic terms begin varies from year to year so please reference the academic calendar.Do I need to participate in an orientation?An online orientation program is required for all program participants. Orientation will be available the week before the start of each semester.How are the online courses organized? Are they self-paced?Most courses within McGeorge online graduate programs are offered on a semester-long basis, with weekly modules. Although format may vary depending on the nature of the course, in most courses students should expect to be assigned new topics each week, with associated reading, lecture, discussion, exercises, quizzes, and other interactive activities. Individual topics that include a specific group of reading assignments, lectures, discussion, and exercises are called modules. Most courses will release new modules each Monday and allow one week for completion.Within the weekly modules, most McGeorge online courses will be primarily asynchronous. This means that students do not necessarily need to be online at the same time, and will have the flexibility to complete module activities at a time convenient to their schedules, as long as they complete the activities by the assigned, typically weekly, deadline. Some assignments, such as weekly discussion, may have mid-week deadlines. Some papers or projects may be assigned over several weeks or the course of a semester. To facilitate planning, all deadlines will be announced in the syllabus prior to the beginning of a course.What are the technical requirements for the online programs?Students need to have regular and reliable access to a computer and high-speed Internet. Note that mobile and tablet devices will not provide full access; students will need a laptop or desktop computer with a webcam.Are courses offered during the summer?There will be two units available over the summer. One of these units will have an optional residential requirement. While this is not required, we highly recommend your participation in the option residential opportunity.Is there a residential component?There is no requirement for an online student to come to our Sacramento campus. However, we highly recommend students to participate in the 1-unit hybrid summer course or come to campus for additional learning opportunities.I live in a state outside of California, can I apply?Per the Department of Education, we must be authorized to educate students in any particular state, therefore only students from pre-authorized states may participate in this program.

Students will be alerted to opportunities to participate in on-campus events through live-streaming and similar technology. If you are able to visit campus, we are happy to provide a campus tour, to introduce you to faculty, to connect with professionals in your area of concentration, and to participate in academic and social events.

We want to make it easier on you! Here are answers to some of the questions we know you\u2019re wondering about.How do I pay for Pacific?The sticker price of attending any college or university can be jarring, but that\u2019s not what you\u2019ll be paying out of pocket. Most students who attend Pacific receive financial aid.\u00a0\u00a0If you submitted a FAFSA and added University of the Pacific, you were automatically considered for federal grants. If you qualify, they will be listed on your financial aid offer letter.If you haven\u2019t submitted your FAFSA, it\u2019s not too late! Apply atfafsa.ed.gov, and be sure to add Pacific \u2014 our school code is 001329. Apply even if you think you won\u2019t qualify \u2014 you might be surprised!When you applied to Pacific, you were automatically considered for a merit award, which is similar to a grant in that you don\u2019t have to pay it back. These are based on academic achievement.\u00a0If you qualify for work-study, it also will be listed on your financial aid offer letter. Work-study jobs not only provide income, but you\u2019ll gain experience and make connections! You can find work-study jobs using Handshake, Pacific\u2019s online job board.You might also consider taking out a student loan, but be sure to research the differences between federal and private loans. Students can qualify for federal loans regardless of income that was listed on the FAFSA and generally have better terms.Once you\u2019ve started attending Pacific, be sure to work with your academic advisor, who will help you plan your degree track so you can finish in the least amount of time possible (and thus pay less for college), if that\u2019s what you desire.For more information about the differences between grants, work-study and loans, and more financial aid resources, visitgo.Pacific.edu/FinancialAid. We hold financial aid webinars for admitted students most Wednesdays through May; be sure to check them out when you\u2019re on the financial aid website!What kind of jobs and internships can help me pay for Pacific?Many students choose to work part-time while attending\u00a0Pacific. Our Career Resource Center can help you find jobs and paid internships, or you can search for yourself on Handshake, Pacific\u2019s online job and opportunity board. It\u2019s easy and common for students to find work\u00a0on campus \u2013 get your resume drafted up and make an appointment atCareer Servicesto get started!Is the food actually good?Without exaggeration, the food on\u00a0Pacific\u2019s\u00a0campus is gourmet.\u00a0In cooperation with our food service provider, Bon Appetit, we strive to provide healthy, delicious meals for every diet using only the freshest\u00a0of ingredients.\u00a0At ourMarketplace, get made-to-order omelets, deli sandwiches, customized pasta and, of course, our famous breakfast burritos\u00a0and more.

We\u00a0get\u00a0it. Pacific has plenty ofhousing options, including Residential Learning Communities (check out ourInstagram Guideon those)!\u00a0Since you\u2019re a new student, you\u2019ll most likely be living in Grace Covell Hall\u00a0or The Quad Communities, which\u00a0both have\u00a0spacious rooms, communal lounges and well-maintained facilities.You can see more\u00a0about\u00a0our residence halls\u00a0on\u00a0our Instagram Highlight: Housing.

Our campus provides resources specifically for first-generation students, like\u00a0First Generation Friday events, support groups atCounseling and Psychological Servicesand\u00a0student organizations dedicated to cultural and academic support.\u00a0We also have other academic\u00a0assistance services, like theStudent Writing Center, free\u00a0academic\u00a0tutoring\u00a0andcareer\u00a0services. And don\u2019t forget that your faculty advisor is there to make sure you graduate and that you are finding and pursuing your passions, so never hesitate to ask for help!What are the campus vibes?The\u00a0Pacific campus is notoriously friendly! In fact, it\u2019s nearly impossible to walk across our campus and not see a friend, classmate, professor\u00a0or staff member you love. Though our faculty and staff on campus are certainly the kindest and\u00a0most\u00a0dedicated people you\u2019ll find at any college, Pacific students truly make our campus a community of love and acceptance. You won\u2019t be competing against your classmates;\u00a0you\u2019ll be working alongside them, supporting each other through some of those tough college courses. So, a word of advice:\u00a0If you don\u2019t want to chat with a dozen friendly faces on your way to class, invest in some headphones and a hoodie.Can and should I bring my car?You\u00a0can\u00a0bring your vehicle,\u00a0and you will need to purchase aparking permitfor just\u00a0$100/year\u00a0to park on campus.\u00a0If you don\u2019t bring your car, you can still explore our\u00a0city!\u00a0Stockton\u2019s public transportation is nationally ranked and one of the first all-electric fleets in California.

Can I use CSO resources?Yes! You are invited to all of our professional development and career skills programs, as well as to our web page, where you'll find a plethora of career-planning resources.Our professional association (The National Association for Law Placement, or \"NALP\") advises that you focus on your studies rather than on job search activities during your first semester. That is why we wait until November to hold our Map Your Career: 1L Orientation to the CSO program, after which we invite you to make one-on-one appointments with our career advisors and utilize our online career management system,McGeorgeCareersOnline.When should I start thinking about internships/externships?The timeline for applying to an internship or externship depends on the individual position. For more information, see our Hiring Practices Guide, Career Map, 1L Timeline, or make an appointment with one of our career advisors.How do I set up an advising appointment?All advising appointments can be made throughSquarespace.Can I do a mock interview at the CSO?Yes, current students and graduates of McGeorge may schedule mock interviews with a CSO career advisor throughSquarespace. We also hold an Alumni/Faculty Mock Interview program in the spring.Can my resume/cover letter be reviewed without an appointment?Students and graduates may submit their resumes and cover letters to be reviewed at any time. The CSO staff does its best to return materials within forty-eight hours. Documents may be submitted in person or tolawcareers@pacific.edu.I am an alumnus and live far away. Can I talk with an advisor by phone?Yes. Our career advisors are more than happy to hold advising appointments over the phone. Just like in-person appointments, phone appointments can be made throughMcGeorgeCareersOnline.Do you review writing samples?We can review writing samples for basic formatting and grammar, and we can discuss which writing sample to use and what you need to include on your writing sample cover page. If you are interested in having the substance of your sample reviewed, we recommend that you contact your professor or McGeorge's Global Lawyering Skills Writing Tutor.How do I get funding for a conference?McGeorge students are eligible for up to $150 (per student, per academic year) in funding to help defray the costs associated with attending professional conferences and recruiting events. To request funding, please complete theConference Reimbursement form. You will be asked to provide general information about the event, its relevance to your professional development and student community interests, and a list of estimated expenses. Priority will be given to requests that contribute to and further the goals of McGeorge School of Law.Additional Questions?Career Services OfficeEmail| 916.739.7011Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

The granting of candidate status denotes a developmental program, which is expected to mature in accord with stated plans and within a defined time period. Reasonable assurances are expected to be provided that the program may become accredited as programmatic experiences are gained, generally, by the time the first class is graduated. Graduates of a class designated as having candidate status have the same rights and privileges as graduates of an accredited program.Learn more about ACEND\u00ae Candidacy for Accreditation.Are courses online or in-person?The majority of Pacific's MSCN courses are delivered via In-Person classroom instruction on our Sacramento campus, but also include some Hybrid courses (combination of In-Person and Online instruction). Students Supervised Clinical Practice Experience (SCPE) courses (NUTR 287A&B) take place at clinical education sites throughout California and some out-of-state facilities.Do I have to locate my own supervised experiential learning sites and/or preceptors?The MSCN program is responsible for identifying SPCE clinical education sites and preceptors and creates the rotation schedule for each student depending on site availability and student needs. It is not the responsibility of students to secure clinical placements. However, students are responsible for making arrangements for their housing and/or commuting plans to assigned clinical education sites, at the student\u2019s expense.Can I complete my supervised clinical practice experience (SCPE) rotations near my hometown?The MSCN program determines clinical education site placements for each trimester depending on site availability, preceptor availability, and student needs. While students\u2019 interests and residence location are elicited and reviewed, the MSCN program cannot guarantee that placements are near their residence. MSCN students can expect to be placed at clinical education sites throughout California. Out-of-state placements can also be considered and discussed with the student at facilities affiliated with Pacific. The program aims to provide adequate notice of placements, so students can make their arrangements for commuting or temporary housing, which is at the student\u2019s expense.Cost and Financial AidHow much does it cost to attend the MSCN program?Our program provides a helpful at-a-glance summary ofTuition and Estimated Expenses. Excluding living expenses which vary by student (housing/meals/transportation), our program expenses are approximately $71,057 for the 16-month program.What kind of financial aid is available?Financial aid packages are tailored to each individual's qualifications and program of study.

This course is often called Experimental Foods (with lab) or Food Science (with lab) (4 units).Can I count my Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) course for both the Macronutrient and Micronutrient Pacific MSCN Course Prerequisites?This is a good question and often depends on the curriculum of your program \u2013 and whether you are completing quarter or semester courses. Different programs also call these courses different names (for example, MNT, human nutrition, advanced nutrition). In general, you can only apply one of your courses completed towards one Pacific MSCN prerequisite course (you can\u2019t list a single course to count as two prerequisites). You will need to carefully review the Course Descriptions and Course Objectives from your Course Catalog or class syllabi to determine which courses address macronutrient and micronutrient metabolism, and your department or major advisor may also be able to offer guidance on which of your courses best fulfill these prerequisites.

Don't worry. We have compiled a list of frequently asked questions just for that purpose.What is the Powell Match?The Powell Match was established through the transformative $125 million Powell Fund, a gift from the estate of Robert and Jeannette Powell. An astute businessman, Bob Powell appreciated an opportunity to leverage his philanthropy to inspire others, and with this program, he continues to do so. The Powells did not graduate from college themselves, yet served as members of the Pacific Board of Regents for many years and believed deeply in the value of a Pacific education. The Powell Fund matches new endowment gifts to Pacific, up to 1:1. More than $60 million is allocated for endowed scholarship matches and $25 million for endowed academic program matches.What is an endowment?An endowment is a permanent fund at the University established with contributions from donors that will be invested in perpetuity. Each year, a portion of the value of the fund is distributed to support the donor's purpose such as student scholarships or program support. Any earnings in excess of this distribution build the fund's market value. The University's current endowment spending policy is 4.0% of market value. Learn more about endowments.What types of endowments qualify for the match?Endowed funds that provide scholarships or academic support to our faculty and academic programs are eligible for the Powell Match Program. Examples of academic program endowments could include support for a specific department, a faculty position, or student learning opportunities such as academic competitions (e.g., forensics or trial advocacy), a lecture series or experiential learning programs. Examples of scholarship endowments could include gap grants, middle-income scholarships, merit scholarships or study abroad scholarships. From the Powell gift, more than $60 million is allocated for endowed scholarship matches and $25 million for endowed academic program matches.What types and size gifts are eligible for the Powell Match?Gifts of $50,000 or more to establish or enhance an endowment may be eligible to receive a Powell Match. Previously unmatched gifts made after October 1, 2012 may be considered for the match if an additional gift or commitment to the endowment is made. Gifts of cash, stock or other assets, including pledges of up to 5 years in length, qualify for 1:1 matching so long as the assets can be liquidated within a 5-year period.Do I have to make my gift in one payment?It is not necessary to make your gift all in one payment. However, neither the match nor the distribution will occur until the University has received the minimum $50,000. Payment schedules of various lengths may be established by the donor with a maximum duration of five years.How long do I have to fund my endowment?Once a gift and or pledge agreement is signed, the donor has a maximum of five years to reach the minimum required $50,000 to guarantee the Powell Match.Who is eligible for the match?Gifts from individual donors or couples, a group of individuals, family foundations or family owned businesses are all eligible to be matched by the Powell Fund.Can more than one person give to the endowment and be matched?Yes! One or more donors may give to an endowment.\u00a0Once that endowment reaches the $50,000 minimum, each and every additional gift will be matched on a quarterly basis for as long as matching funds are available.Does my employer's company qualify for the match as well?The Powell Fund will match both your gift and your company's matching contribution. Your company's match can also count toward the $50,000 minimum to qualify for the Powell Match. \u00a0So in effect, between the Powell Fund Match and a 1:1 match from your employer, your gift will be quadrupled.Example:$50,000 donor gift + employer match + $100,000 Powell Match = $200,000 endowmentDo planned gifts (deferred gifts) qualify for the match?Planned (deferred) gifts are not eligible for matching.When will the match occur?The match is made available after a gift or payments received toward a pledge total $50,000 or more. Your endowment is established in the quarter that the minimum $50,000 is received. The Powell Match portion is added at the same time.When will a new endowment start being used?If the endowment is funded by June 30, it will have a full distribution (currently at 4%) annually starting the fall after one year of investment. If the endowment has met the minimum after June 30, but prior to Dec. 31, the fund will have a half distribution (2%) starting the following fall and then a full (4%) annual distribution each subsequent year.Gift AmountPowell MatchTotal EndowmentPayment ReceivedDistributionEstimated Amount$50,000$50,000$100,000June 30, 2019Fall 2020$4,000$50,000$50,000$100,000Dec. 31, 2019Fall 2020$2,000Fall 2021$4,000How do I get started?Contact any University of the Pacific gift officer or Tod Davis, Powell Match Manager, at 209.946.2502 ortdavis@pacific.edu.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

The COA includes tuition and fees; housing and food; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees and personal expenses.CSAC* \u2014 California Student Aid CommissionCSAC offers a number of California state grant programs for college students, including the Cal Grant. Students who receive Cal Grant funding are subject to state regulations which govern the total amount of additional gift aid (grants and scholarships) they are eligible to receive. Students must submit a FAFSA, meet state residency requirements and other eligibility criteria.EFC* \u2014 Expected Family ContributionA comparative measure, calculated according to the need analysis formula specified by law and based on the information from the FAFSA, of the minimum amount the student/family can be expected to contribute to the cost of the student\u2019s education for one academic year. The EFC is used to determine a student\u2019s eligibility for federal aid like grants, loans and work-study as well as assistance from other sources, including grants from University of the Pacific.FAFSA* \u2014 Free Application for Federal Student AidThe FAFSA is the only approved application currently in use that can be used to apply for Title IV or federal financial aid in the U.S. The analysis of the FAFSA yields an EFC that is then used to calculate a student\u2019s eligibility for financial aid. The FAFSA can be filed beginning October 1 prior to the next academic year. First-time applicants can file the FAFSA and returning students can submit a renewal FAFSA for free.Need*The difference between a student\u2019s Cost of Attendance (COA) and the student\u2019s calculated contribution, the EFC. The COA minus the EFC equals the student\u2019s financial need. The student\u2019s need is the maximum eligibility for need-based aid. The possible calculated EFCs range from $0 to $999,999. COA \u2013 EFC = NeedSAP* \u2014 Satisfactory Academic ProgressStudents must maintain the university\u2019s minimum Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards as one condition of renewing the COVID-19 Relief Scholarship. Briefly, the SAP regulations require students to meet certain grade point average (GPA) and rate-of-credit accumulation thresholds.Students who fall below the GPA and credit accumulation thresholds will lose their eligibility for the COVID-19 Relief Scholarship as well as other financial aid. Students who experienced significant, documentable, extenuating circumstances are permitted to appeal. Students who successfully appeal are able to receive financial aid on a probationary basisTitle IV* \u2014 Federal Student AidFederal financial aid programs for postsecondary students, authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). The programs are administered by the U.S. Department of Education and include those offered at Pacific among others. Title IV federal student aid programs offered at Pacific include:In order to apply for the Title IV programs, the student must submit the FAFSA for the applicable award year.

Any Accelerated Honors Program applicant who is not admitted to that program will be given full consideration for the traditional JD program.Can I enroll in the Accelerated Honors Program after my first year is completed?No. Unfortunately, we have structured the curriculum to start in the spring semester of the Accelerated Honors Students' first year.Am I eligible to participate in study abroad programs as an Accelerated Honors Program student?Participating in a study abroad program is possible if you coordinate and plan accordingly to ensure you are meeting all of the requirements including the honors externship. To stay on track with the accelerated program, you will need to earn externship credits either during the year or in your two other summers. You can fulfill the regular experiential requirement of two capstone experiences over the course of your second and third year, but will need to make up the 7 units from the first summer with a combination of summer coursework or additional units during intersession or during the remaining semesters.Is my tuition covered during my summer honors externship?Yes, you are eligible for seven credit hours of free summer tuition. This can be used for the externship or for summer courses if you opt to study abroad after your first year.What GPA do I need to have to remain in the Accelerated Honors Program and how is it calculated?You must maintain a 3.00 GPA. GPA is calculated the same for AHP and regular JD students. For the first year, GPA is calculated based on the fall and spring semesters. For the second year, GPA is calculated based on any course taken during the summer before the second year and the fall and spring semesters of the second year. AHP students stay with the same entering cohort (of both regular JD and AHP students) throughout their time at McGeorge for GPA calculations and ranking.If your GPA falls below 3.0, you will need to meet with the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs or the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs to discuss your academic planning. If you improve your GPA during your second year and continue your progress towards completion of your JD a semester early, you may still graduate with AHP recognition as long as your final GPA exceeds 3.0. You may also be advised to discontinue the acceleration of your JD pursuit and graduate without the AHP designation.Where do most of your student's extern?Most students in the accelerated honors program will participate in an externship during the first summer after they commence law school. Externships will be full time for 10 weeks, and students will earn seven (7) credits. Example of externship placements include:Trial and Appellate Judges (state and federal)California Attorney General's Office (various divisions)Fair Political Practice CommissionFranchise Tax BoardDistrict Attorney's OfficePublic Defender's OfficeCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency \u2013 State Water Resources Control BoardCalifornia Department of Human ResourcesChildren's Law CenterCalifornia Department of Managed Health CareOther externship placements at non-profit and governmental agencies and organizations are also available and each student will be individually placed with consideration given to her or his area of interest.What is the benefit of participating in the Accelerated Honors Program?Accelerated Honors students will obtain their law licenses and be eligible to start practicing while their peers are preparing for the bar exam and therefore will begin working as attorneys or policy makers six months ahead of their peers in traditional three-year full-time programs.Because students in the Accelerated Honors Program participate in a free summer externship as part of the program, students in McGeorge's unique program save thousands of dollars.The most accurate way to compare the cost of attending McGeorge's Accelerated Honors Program is to discount the total cost of attendance by the free summer externship and the six months of income students will earn while their peers are studying for and taking the bar exam and waiting for their results.What is the purpose of the interview requirement?The interview provides an opportunity for both parties to ensure that your participation in this program will provide you all the opportunities for success available. Your application allows us to ascertain certain things about you, but an interview gives us an opportunity to talk with you about your experiences and determine whether the accelerated honors program is likely to be a good fit for you.Can I participate in mock trial, moot court, law review if I am a member of the Accelerated Honors Program?Like all McGeorge students, you will have the opportunity to earn a spot on our competition teams and/or law review. Our teams are nationally recognized and participating in them brings many opportunities to hone your craft and prepare you for your legal career. Because Mock Trial and Moot Court are designed to be year-long experiences, participation in these activities in your third year may be somewhat restricted.What if I start in the Accelerated Honors Program and change my mind?No problem. Depending on when you decide, you will be able to take a lighter load of classes.\u00a0Once you have elected to drop the AHP program, reentry is not possible.What are the eligibility requirements?Competitive students will have excellent academic credentials and distinctive life experiences to support successful completion of an accelerated JD degree. Students with a 157 LSAT score and a 3.3 or better undergraduate grade point average (UGPA) or a 156 and 3.5 or better UGPA presumptively will qualify for an interview. Students whose entrance credentials do not meet these prerequisites may qualify for an interview if their LSAT score and UGPAs are similar to these requirements and other aspects of their application justify further evaluation of their candidacy for the program.How does the Accelerated Honors Program give me a competitive advantage in the legal employment market?It helps in two ways. First, it puts you in the legal market sooner at a time when many other legal graduates are not job-searching. Second, your designation as an Accelerated Honors graduate is a mark of distinction that is likely to be impressive to future employers.How will potential employers know that I've completed the Accelerated Honors JD Program?As a new program, many employees will likely be unfamiliar with what it required to complete your degree faster than average. Placing this on your resume will undoubtedly open the door for you to discuss the nuances of the program and your ability to perform at such a rigorous academic level. You will also receive a certificate upon graduation and a designation on the commencement program. Will I select my own summer honors externship or will one be assigned to me? McGeorge will provide a list of opportunities, and the Director of Externships will work with you personally to find the best fit for you. We have a wide range of approved externship sites and will be able to find an experience to align with your interests and experiences.If I do not maintain the required GPA for the Accelerated Honors JD Program, how will I be integrated into the traditional JD program?Your integration with the three-year program will be seamless. You will have been taking classes with students in the three-year curriculum all along, and you will continue to do so if you end up in the traditional program.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

For more information or to make an appointment, please emailpr@pacific.edu. Our complete policies and information can be found below.FormsApplications are available to students, faculty and other qualified professionals who wish to study the collection.Student Research Request FormFaculty Research Request FormVisiting Scholar Research Request FormPoliciesAccession and Deaccession of Human SkullsThe Atkinson Collection contains over 2400 accessioned human skulls, crania and mandibles. The majority of these individuals were acquired by Dr. Spencer R. Atkinson, an eminent orthodontist and craniofacial researcher, from 1919 to 1963. The University of the Pacific received his private collection in 1963. Subsequent additions have resulted from the dental school's human gross anatomy course during the early 1990s. More recently, a number of dental school alumni have donated skulls that they had purchased from biological supply houses during their dental school days.The Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study (CDHCS) makes every effort to ensure the continued security and preservation of donated skulls. Museum-quality cabinets and archival-quality trays house the Atkinson Collection. Specimens are handled minimally. During research studies involving examination of the skulls, curator assistance is mandatory.Acquisition GuidelinesSkulls donated to CDHCS must be recognizable as originally purchased from a biological supply house (i.e., specimen obviously prepared under laboratory conditions, with tissue removal, degreasing, and bleaching having resulted from standardized preparation techniques) or designated as non-Native American in ethnicity. Subsequent to receipt of a specimen, CDHCS staff may request a 30 day examination period if the specimen's derivation seems questionable.All acquisitions are to be outright and unconditional. Skull donations must be made with the understanding that, while the donor's preference may be taken into consideration, CDHCS staff will determine whether to accession the specimen into the main research collection or into the smaller teaching collection.Federal law prevents CDHCS from providing identification services or appraisal values for donated skulls. Donors are responsible for appraisals of value. Please contact biological supply houses or internet companies specializing in human osteological remains to determine approximate values. CDHCS is in no way affiliated with these organizations.Accession ProcessAccession RecordUpon receipt, the donation will be examined and described for accessioning purposes in an Accession Record. The donor will receive a copy of the Accession Record containing the following:Acquisition information: date received, CDHCS receiver's name, method of delivery of specimen to CDHCS;Donor information: donor's name, address, phone number and email address;Donation information: description of specimen, documentation relating to specimen, accession number and catalogue number(s) assigned;Donor Release statement: \"The objects listed above (and/or on attached list), when accepted by Museum Committee, become the sole and permanent property of Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study of the University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry. This gift is subject to no restrictions or conditions. Objects may be photographed or otherwise reproduced, exhibited or studied solely at the discretion of CDHCS. Determinations of value for tax purposes is the responsibility of the donor;\"Donor signature and date;Acceptance information (completed by CDHCS): indication of Museum Committee action to accept or reject donation;Name of recipient and date of return, if specimen is returned from CDHCS to donor.DeaccessioningAll donations to CDHCS are irrevocable upon the formal and physical transfer to CDHCS. Subsequent to accession, if a specimen is later deemed to fall outside CDHCS guidelines for acceptance, the donor will be contacted and the specimen deaccessioned and returned to the donor.Conditions Governing Skull LoansThe Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy and the P&S Comparative Anatomy skull collections are open to research by all qualified personnel. At the present time, all previous external loans have been recalled by University of the Pacific. Only limited future external loans will be considered. Loans will be assessed on their scientific merit, with priority given to maintaining the integrity of the collections.All loan requests must be submitted in writing on institutional letterhead and addressed to:CuratorAtkinson Collection, Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study (CDHCS)University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry155 Fifth StreetSan Francisco, CA 94103A report of research findings must be provided to the Curator at the conclusion of a research loan regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.Imaging Restrictions: Loaned specimens may be CT scanned, photographed, X-rayed, videotaped or otherwise imaged only if separate permission is granted in advance.Research and Teaching LoansFaculty and Visiting Scholar Research LoansThe following information must be provided in research loan requests submitted by dental school faculty and by scholars and institutions outside of University of the Pacific:Explanation of why loan is necessary, or why doing research at CDHCS is impossiblePurpose of the loan, including a paragraph defining general research hypothesis and methodology and expected resultsNature of study procedure, including anatomical structures to be examined or measuredMethod of examination or measurement, including calipers, other osteometric devices, 3D digitizer, photographic equipment, X-ray equipment, CT scan equipment, or otherPrevious experience using calipers and 3D digitizer, if these instruments are to be used during your study.Faculty Teaching/Demonstration LoansA portion of the skull collections are available to faculty of the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry for teaching Selective classes or for short-term demonstrations in the classroom or laboratory setting. These are usually one- to two-day loans, but may be longer depending on need. On the day of the loan, the faculty member wishing to borrow specimens for class use purposes will be required to read and sign CDHCS's Faculty Teaching/Demonstration Loan form that contains the following: Instructor information: name, phone extension and e-mail address, class title and brief description, approx. class size; Specimen information: specimen catalogue number(s), juvenile or adult specimen, pre- and post-loaned condition of each specimen; Loan information: beginning and ending loan date(s), CDHCS loan approval and approval date, loan return date, brief summaries of specimen care and handling guidelines, and acknowledgement of conditions governing loans. The Faculty Teaching/Demonstration Loan form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Research Loans to StudentsLoans are not made to students. Students wishing to conduct research involving specimens from the skull collections must do so at CDHCS where the collections are housed.Exhibit LoansA completed AAM Standard Facility Report (available for purchase on the AAM website: (under \"Bookstore\") is required. The following information must be described in the exhibit loan request:Purpose of the loan, including exhibit type and location;List of specimen numbers or number and types of specimens requested;Explanation of why the specimens are needed for the exhibit; andA time framework, including shipping, photography, installation and exhibition dates.Traveling Exhibit LoansLoans are not made for traveling exhibit purposes.Commercial Use LoansThe borrowing of specimens for commercial or business for-profit use is limited to those projects that result in products of educational, research, or otherwise scientific value. No products incorporating or based on the borrowed specimens shall be produced without individualized contract document development and licensing approval by University of the Pacific. (See \"Commercial/Business Use and Images\" section for specific policy regarding images of specimens from the skull collections.) To initiate the loan procedure, the following information must be described in the commercial use loan request:Purpose of the loan, specifying all anticipated product development and product useList of specimen numbers or number and types of specimens requestedSpecific means of extracting product data from the specimens, including making casts, photographs, X-rays, CT scans, or other methodsLoan LimitationsTen specimens will be the maximum loaned at any one time. Loan requests subsequent to loan of the initial ten specimens will not be automatically granted and require submission of a new loan request. Rare specimens from the collections will not be loaned under any circumstances. Loans are not made internationally.Loan ConditionsBorrowerLoans are not made to individuals. Loans are made to non-profit, educational institutions for educational and scholarly purposes. If an individual researcher is affiliated with a museum, the loan agreement must be signed by the Director or Registrar of the receiving institution. If the individual researcher is affiliated with an academic department, the agreement must be signed by the department chairperson.Purpose of LoanSpecimens loaned by CDHCS may not be used for any purposes other than that agreed upon. Specimens may not be lent by the Borrower or individual researcher to a third party without the written permission of CDHCS.ScheduleAll non-teaching loans require a minimum of two months to process from the time that approval is granted and a final list of specimens is determined. Teaching loan requests should be submitted at least three weeks in advance.Loan Insurance for Loss/DamageThe borrower is responsible for the cost of insuring all borrowed specimens (and skull boxes used for transport) from the time they leave CDHCS until the time they are returned. Prior to releasing specimens for loan, CDHCS must receive from the borrower a memorandum and certificate of insurance from a fine arts insurance policy showing wall-to-wall coverage subject to standard exclusions with no deductible. Insurance coverage through the University of the Pacific is not available for purchase by the borrower.A borrower who wishes to insure objects under their own insurance coverage should submit a copy of their fine arts insurance policy listing any deductibles and exclusions for review by the University of the Pacific Office of Risk Management. This information should be submitted when the formal loan request is made.The certificate of insurance must show the value of each specimen to be insured for loss or damage as follows: adult, juvenile or in utero/newborn cranium or mandible, or both \u2014 $3000; cranium or mandible, or both, of a specimen exhibiting a pathological or anomalous condition (as determined by the CDHCS curator) \u2014 $5000. The borrower will be charged for any damage to specimens (see below) incurred during the loan period, including fragmentation of teeth, breakage of bone, and any other form of alteration of the specimens from their original loaned condition. Damage fees will be assessed between $50 - $200 per specimen per incident, based on the severity of the damage and time required for repair by CDHCS staff.Recall of LoanCDHCS reserves the right to recall the loan for any reason and requires return of the recalled loan within three weeks.Transportation/Packing/StorageThe method of transportation of loaned skulls is by hand carry only. The individual researcher, or a designated courier (CDHCS staff, or a professional courier approved by CDHCS and University of the Pacific), will hand carry the skulls to their destination. Each skull will be packed by CDHCS personnel in a loaned skull box with appropriate packing materials prior to transport. The skull boxes and packing material should be stored in appropriate facilities for preservation. The researcher will repack loans in the same or similar material. If a CDHCS staff member or outside professional is chosen as the courier, all courier expenses, including airline tickets, lodging, courier fee (for supervising unpacking, mounting, installation, de-installation, and repacking), and any other unforeseen expenditures will be paid by the borrower. At the designated destination, the researcher will make arrangements necessary for storage of the loaned skulls in a secured room prior to and after use.Care/PreservationThe individual researcher will protect loans from mishandling, dirt, insects, fire, theft, and extreme variations in light, temperature and humidity at all times. Loans will be handled only by the researcher and experienced professional assistants. Specimen handling will be kept to a minimum. The researcher and assistants will comply with all special handling instructions required by CDHCS in the Specimen Handling Guidelines. The researcher will not clean, repair or alter a loaned specimen (see below). CDHCS reserves the right to inspect the installation and/or use of specimens at any time.SecurityFor exhibit purposes, specimens must be displayed in closed, locked cases. For research or commercial purposes, specimens must be placed in closed, locked cases, so as not to be visible when in storage.Damage/LossRegardless of who is responsible, if a borrowed specimen is damaged or lost while in transit, during unpacking or packing, when being examined, measured, photographed, CT scanned, videotaped, or X-rayed, during installation or de-installation of a display, or while on display, the event must be reported immediately by telephone, fax or email to the CDHCS curator. If pieces of teeth or bone are broken off the specimen, every effort must be made to recover those pieces and return them safely to CDHCS along with the specimen. The researcher may not carry out repairs without the permission of the CDHCS curator. Should any incident occur regarding the borrowed specimen, whether or not damage is apparent, the event must be reported immediately and in writing to CDHCS.Examination/Mounting/Installation RestrictionsNo marker, pencil, pen, paint or other marks of any kind may be made on the specimens during measuring, photographing, scanning, videotaping, mounting or installing. No tape, museum wax, dental wax, glue, nails, screws, staples, wires or other materials may be placed on or into the specimens.Exhibit LabelsIf exhibited, the specimen label should include the following credit line: \"Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy, University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California\" accompanied by the specimen's catalogue number.Exhibit Publicity and ReproductionsWhile on display, specimens may be photographed for use within the exhibition space itself or for Condition reports. Permission for any other use, such as a publication, or printed or electronic promotional materials (i.e., posters, postcards, booklets, photographs, etc.), or items bearing those images (i.e., gift shop mugs, key chains, etc.), must be received in writing from CDHCS. If the researcher receives permission to make photographs for the purpose of an electronic or print publication or publicity, or item of merchandise, CDHCS requests one set of labeled photos and items for its archives. Photography by the general public is not allowed. Subjecting objects to any artificial or natural light beyond that agreed upon for display purposes requires separate permission from the CDHCS.Catalogue/Publication/Research FindingsIf a publication accompanies the exhibition or results from research, CDHCS requests two copies for its archives. CDHCS also requests copies of promotional materials that contain its specimens. If published, the specimen caption should include the following credit line: \"Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy, University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California\" accompanied by the specimen's catalogue number. A report of research findings must be provided to CDHCS at the conclusion of a loan made for research purposes regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.Loan ProcessLoan Approval Letter and Loan AgreementFollowing consideration of the initial loan request by the CDHCS curator, and approval by the museum chairperson and administration representative, the borrower and individual researcher they represent will be notified of the approval, in writing, and provided with an invoice for administrative fees and related costs, if any. An itemized list of specimen insurance values will be included within the letter. Once the borrower has complied with loan agreement conditions, and provided a memorandum and certificate of insurance, the loan agreement will be signed by all parties. Once the loan agreement form is signed, no additions to the specimen list are permitted.Loan FormIn addition to possible formal loan agreement documentation, on the day of the loan the researcher will sign an appropriate loan form that will contain, depending on which type of loan, some portion of the following information: specimen catalogue number(s); value of specimen(s); insuring party; researcher's name, phone number, affiliation and email address; brief description of the purpose of loan; proposed means of transport; anticipated date of return; age of each specimen; loaned condition of each specimen (see Loan Condition Report below); brief summaries of specimen care and handling guidelines, and acknowledgement of conditions governing loans. The loan form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Loan Condition ReportWhen the loan is processed, the CDHCS curator will record the skull condition within the faculty teaching/demonstration loan form, including damaged and/or missing areas of the skull and dentition, and congenital conditions. In signing the loan form, the instructor agrees that the borrowed specimens are received in the recorded condition.Loan Period and Renewal of LoanLoans are generally made for a maximum of six months. Requests for renewal must be made in writing to the curator and received 30 days before the expiration of the loan. The loan will be reviewed by the curator, museum committee, and administration representative if more than two renewal requests are submitted.Return of LoanThe researcher agrees to return the loan only to the CDHCS curator, by the date specified in the signed loan agreement, unless other arrangements are agreed to in advance by CDHCS.Loan FeesLoan Handling FeeResearch and exhibit loans are not subject to the administrative loan handling fee. Commercial use loans are subject to the administrative loan handling fee and will be charged a flat rate of $200 per specimen borrowed. This fee covers the cost of locating specimens, producing a loan condition report, processing forms, and packing, receiving and returning specimens to storage. Additional fees apply to commercial use loans that result in product development and distribution, as indicated in the Production of Images section.Loan Request Cancellation FeeOnce a formal loan request has been received from a non-UOP researcher, and review by CDHCS staff has begun, if the loan request is cancelled, withdrawn or postponed indefinitely by the researcher, a loan request cancellation fee of $50 will be charged to the borrower, whether the loan request was made on behalf of a prospective research project, exhibit or for commercial use. In addition, should the commercial use borrower cancel a loan request after a cost, such as the loan handling fee, has been incurred by CDHCS on behalf of the borrower, the borrower is responsible for that cost.InterpretationIn the event of any conflict between this agreement and any forms of the borrower, the terms of this agreement shall be controlling.Research Access to Skull CollectionsResearch RequestsThe Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy (Atkinson Collection) and P&S Comparative Anatomy collections are open to research by all qualified personnel. Access to the collections is by appointment only. Appointments are scheduled by the CDHCS curator upon receipt of a written statement of research objectives and data collection methods. (See links to research request forms at the top of this page.) All research requests should be emailed toCDHCScurator@pacific.eduon institutional letterhead addressed to:CDHCS CuratorUniversity of the PacificArthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry155 Fifth StreetSan Francisco, CA 94103A report of research findings must be provided to the CDHCS curator at the conclusion of a research study regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.University of the Pacific Faculty and Students, and Visiting ScholarsTo gain research access to the skull collections, please complete the appropriate Research Request application available at this site (see Forms), or request an application form from the CDHCS curator.Research Approval ProcessFor adequate review and scheduling, research requests must be submitted at least three months in advance by visiting scholars and one month in advance by dental school faculty and students. Proposed visit date(s) and study duration will be discussed at the time of research request submission to determine the feasibility of dates and times. Following consideration and approval of the research request by the CDHCS curator, the researcher will be notified of the approval in writing.Research ConditionsResearchersResearch permission is granted only to faculty and students of the University of the Pacific, to visiting scholars affiliated with academic institutions and to medical and dental professionals.Research Use FormOn the day of the visit, the researcher will sign a Research Use Form that contains the following information: Researcher's name, phone number, affiliation or professional address, email address, a brief description of conditions governing research use, and a list of specimens examined. The Research Use Form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Designated Research AreaResearch study of the skull collections by University of the Pacific faculty and students, and by visiting scholars must take place at the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry in the CDHCS's designated research area. Special permission must be obtained to transport specimens to nearby facilities, inside or outside the dental school, for photographing, X-raying or CT scanning.Specimen SelectionTo facilitate the sample selection process, an on-site Atkinson database is now available for use by researchers. Pre-selection of skulls using images and information in the database will minimize the visitor's need to survey the collection itself, an activity CDHCS discourages due to collection preservation concerns. If preferable, based on the objectives of the study and in consultation with the researcher, the CDHCS curator will select a specific or random sample of specimens from the skull collection.Care and PreservationThe curator will do most of the handling of the specimens, retrieving them from the storage cabinets for study and returning them after examination is completed. In this manner the potential for damage to the specimens is minimized. On the first day of the study, the researcher will be asked to read CDHCS's Procedural Advice for Handling Skulls guidelines and to sign a research form. There are no restrictions on the number of specimens available for study.Research FeesCurrently there are no research fees charged to students and faculty, or to visiting scholars.Teaching Access to Skull CollectionsTeaching Requests\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Off-Site or On-Site LocationThe P&S Comparative Anatomy Collection and a subset of specimens from the Atkinson Collection are available to University of the Pacific faculty for teaching and class demonstrations located either off-site within the dental school building or on-site in room 410, the CDHCS facility. These requests should follow instructions found in the Conditions Governing Skull Loans, Faculty Teaching/Demonstration Loans section of this web page. To allow adequate time for retrieving specimens and completing a Loan Condition Report, the teaching access request must be submitted at least three weeks in advance to the CDHCS curator.Teaching ConditionsUse of specimens from the skull collections must take place within designated off-site teaching areas, such as laboratories and classrooms, or on-site in CDHCS. On the day of the class, the Instructor will be asked to read CDHCS's Procedural Advice for Handling Skulls guidelines and to sign a Faculty Teaching/Demonstration Loan form. To minimize potential damage to the specimens, Instructors are expected to provide supervision for student handling of specimens or to read the Handling Skulls guidelines to the class.If in an off-site location, the specimens must be kept behind locked doors before and after the class, usually in the Instructor's office, before being returned to CDHCS. As indicated in the loan form, Instructors are responsible for the safekeeping of specimens borrowed from the skull collections.In the on-site CDHCS location, the research table (5'x10') can accommodate a maximum seated class size of 8. For larger classes, standing groups of 20-25 students may be rotated in and out of the room.Teaching Requests\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Off-Site or On-Site LocationThe Comparative Anatomy Collection and a subset of specimens from the Atkinson Collection are available to University of the Pacific faculty for teaching and class demonstrations located either off-site within the dental school building or on-site in room 410, the CDHCS facility. These requests should follow instructions found in the Conditions Governing Skull Loans, Faculty Teaching/Demonstration Loans section of this web page.

For example, we see students with symptoms of anxiety and / or depression, we see couples with relationship difficulties, we see individuals with mental illnesses such as Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, and we see students who are adjusting to living away from home for the first time. These are all typical of the types of issues or concerns that we handle on a daily basis.Is there a limit to how long I can receive therapy at CAPS?Yes. Since we try to serve as many students as possible, in most cases we limit the number of sessions you can be seen each year.

If you think you want or need longer term therapy, you will need to discuss your therapy needs with your therapist.Is everything confidential? Can my parents or professors find out I've been to CAPS?The records at Counseling and Psychological Services are totally separate from the rest of your records at Pacific. For the most part, the fact that you have come to CAPS and what you discussed here is confidential and will not be revealed to anyone outside of CAPS. However, there are rare exceptions. For example, if you tell us that a child or someone over the age of 65 is being abused, we have to report that to the appropriate agency. If you tell us that you plan to seriously hurt yourself or someone else, we may have to intervene to ensure everyone's safety. We also sometimes work in conjunction with medical staff at Pacific Health Services and / or with the Student Victim Advocate. These exceptions are detailed in the Informed Consent statement you will be given during your first appointment. Additionally, the therapist you see will answer any further questions you have about exceptions to confidentiality.Is it true that you won't see some students? My friend said you wouldn't give him counseling and told him to see a private therapist.We will meet with any student for an initial assessment. There are circumstances in which the therapist determines that an individual's needs are beyond the scope of the services offered at CAPS. In these instances, we will offer a referral to other sources of help on or off campus.What if I need medication?CAPS has a part-time psychiatrist that is available 9 hours a week (Monday and Wednesday mornings, Tuesday afternoons) and works with students across our three campuses.

Also, filing a report helps the University create a safe and welcoming campus climate that better supports everyone's ability to learn and/or work. If bias-related incidents go unreported, it makes it difficult for the University to appropriately address the issue, it diminishes campus climate, it may make some members of our community feel unsafe or unwelcome, or additional incidents may occur.What happens after a report has been filed?Because Pacific remains deeply committed to promoting and maintaining a civil community and maintaining a community that is respectful of all persons, the University will address all reported incidents that violate the student code of conduct, University policies and/or federal, state and local laws.An individual filing a report should know that once the University has received a report, the following steps typically occur:Confirmation that the report has been received will be communicated within 2 business days (should the individual(s) filing the report choose to include his/her name and contact information).Careful review of the details of the report to ensure that we have accurately understood the nature of the occurrence or violation.Conduct outreach to gather any additional relevant information that may be required in order determine what, if any, conduct, policy or legal violation has occurred:The process may include contacting individuals or groups who may have been involved in the occurrence as a bystander, a reporter or a respondent in order to obtain more information and/or it may include communicating with other appropriate campus officials, departments/offices or organizations.The University reserves the right to review incidents which may have occurred on and off campus when it involves a member of the Pacific community and depending upon the seriousness of the alleged conduct, policy or legal violation.Provide a safe setting for anyone involved in the incident to share information about what has occurred and as needed, make referrals to appropriate campus and community resources including the University's Victim's Advocate Program and the Counseling Center among others:Individuals will have an opportunity to learn what services are available to assist them as well as how to access and utilize those services.Determine an appropriate response to an occurrence, which may require assistance from appropriate campus offices or departments.In the case of students, the office of student conduct may be referred to.Matters involving University employees may be referred to Human Resources.Initiate appropriate outreach and education since the unfortunate occurrence of an incident may create specific educational opportunities for those connected to the incident through additional interventions:It provides the University with an opportunity to restate our commitment to Pacific's principles \"that diversity and inclusion are essential to the fulfillment of our institutional mission. We value inclusiveness in learning, curricular and co-curricular programming, campus climate, recruitment, admissions, hiring and retention.\"Depending upon the nature of the incident and the type of response that is required, key campus officials may initiate meetings with appropriate individuals or affinity groups to offer ongoing support, advocacy and/or updated information.Educating everyone, students, faculty, staff, alumni and our local community, about bias-related matters is important. Further, without breaching anyone's confidentiality or right to privacy, this may be an opportunity to develop curricular and co-curricular experiences that can be offered throughout the academic year that foster the advancement of diversity and inclusion.The Bias Response process is managed through the Senior Director of Culture and Belonging,\u00a0Rolly Kali-Rai,\u00a0who\u00a0may be contacted atrkalirai@pacific.edu.Will the campus community be notified of the outcome?It should be noted that to the extent that federal, state and local law as well as University policies permit, Pacific will keep appropriate individuals and groups apprised of the progress of an investigation and the final outcome on a \"need-to-know\" basis.To protect the privacy of all the individuals or groups involved, the University may not be able to release some of the details related to the incident; however, a summary report of all bias reporting, outcomes and findings will be used to proactively guide education and prevention efforts to foster culture and belonging.To remain compliant with the Clery Act, reported hate crimes will become a part of the mandatory documentation that is posted regularly with the Office of Public Safety's crime statistics.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

This program allows institutions of higher learning (degree granting institutions) in the United States to voluntarily enter into an agreement with VA to fund tuition expenses that exceed the highest public in-state undergraduate tuition rate. The institution can contribute up to 50% of those expenses and the VA will match the same amount at the institution.Who is eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program?Only veterans entitled to the maximum benefit rate of 100 percent, as determined by the service requirements, or their designated transferees may receive Yellow Ribbon benefits from Pacific and the VA.

Here you will find information about:Cost and Financial AidThe public administration and public policy programs and the McGeorge School of LawCurriculum and RequirementsStudent LifeIf you have a question that isn't answered here,please contact us.Cost and Financial AidAre scholarships available?Each application to the MPA and MPP programs is automatically considered for scholarships. If accepted, the letter of admission will include details about the scholarship assistance McGeorge is able to offer. Most students receive a scholarship. Scholarship amounts are dependent on the strength of the application, the timing of the recruitment cycle, and other factors. For this reason, it is strongly encouraged that prospective applicants submit their application as early as possible to maximize the benefits which are available to them. Additionally, the McGeorge Financial Aid office is available to advise on Federal assistance programs, and other options available to graduate students.How much do the programs cost?Each semester, students pay tuition based on the number of units they are taking. Tuition for the 2023-24 academic year is $1,500 per unit, and students enroll in 4-12 units per semester. Fees for the Wellness Center and student activities range from $140 to $215 per semester. Finally, all students are required to have health insurance. If a student is not already covered under a health insurance plan, they will be required to purchase the student health insurance plan. Total tuition for the 36-unit MPA degree is $54,000 and for the 44-unit MPP degree is $66,000 before accounting for scholarships and other financial aid. Scholarships range from 10% to 50% of tuition.What financial aid is available?All students are considered for partial tuition scholarships when they apply. In addition, federal student loans and on-campus work-study jobs are available for qualified students who complete the FAFSA.Can federal loans be forgiven by public service?Some federal loans can be partially forgiven if employed in public service.Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF)Does McGeorge participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program for veterans?McGeorge is proud to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program.Information about Eligibility & BenefitsThe MPA/MPP Programs and the McGeorge School of LawDoes the American Bar Association accredit the MPP or MPA degrees?No, the ABA only accredits the JD degree at any law school, including McGeorge. The American Bar Association approved offering this degree through McGeorge School of Law by granting \"acquiescence\" In 2015. This allowed the MPA and MPP programs to be offered under the law school as well as allowing JD students to take public policy courses as electives.How does this program fit into law degrees at McGeorge?McGeorge School of Law offers the JD, MSL, LLM, and JSD law-related degrees and two non-law degrees \u2014 the MPP and MPA. The public policy and law degrees complement and strengthen each other. You will take at least two law courses among your required courses and more for an area of concentration. Law students may enroll in public policy courses and some students will pursue both a JD and MPP or JD and MPA degree.Is it possible to earn a JD degree as well as a MPP or a MPA?Through McGeorge\u2019s dual-degree program, you can earn both the JD and the MPP or MPA with just one more year of study in addition to that required for the JD, but saving a year compared to pursuing both degrees independently. Admission to the JD program requires a separate application, and admission into the MPA or MPP program does not guarantee admission into the dual-degree program for the JD.McGeorge\u2019s dual-degree programWhat is McGeorge\u2019s Influence in the Community?McGeorge School of Law has been educating lawyers in Sacramento since the 1920s. McGeorge alumni dominate lists of the 100 most influential attorneys in Sacramento and McGeorge alumni are leaders in state agencies, lobbying firms and non-profit organizations as well as law firms in Sacramento and beyond.Members of our McGeorge family serve on nonprofit boards, provide pro-bono legal services, and participate as active community volunteers for dozens of local and national community outreach organizations. Students, faculty, staff and alumni contribute thousands of hours annually to support important community and charitable efforts.Curriculum and RequirementsWhat are classes like?Our courses are typically comprised of 10-25 students. Classes are structured to allow for a working schedule, with most courses being offered in-person during the evenings or on weekends. While a few courses and individual class sessions are on-line, the vast majority of classes are taught in-person on our Sacramento campus.In PUB classes, students engage in spirited policy discussions and learn about innovative management approaches from experienced professionals. Most assignments take the form of recognized professional work products, such as a decision memo, an analysis to be presented to a committee of the California state legislature, an issue brief or comment on a proposed regulation. Some assignments are individual, while others are based on team work.Is a thesis required?No. Our Masters of Public Administration and Masters of Public Policy programs focus on practical professional skills. Instead of writing a thesis (a type of document you are unlikely to replicate later in your career) you'll participate in a capstone course. This capstone course requires students to construct a professional presentation on a major issue of public administration and/or policy by pulling together the knowledge and skills gained from all previous classes.How Should I choose between the MPA and the MPP?Are you most interested in working with others to implement public policies? Do you like partnering with or managing others in direct actions? If so, the MPA, which emphasizes leading and managing competencies, is a good choice. Are you most interested in analyzing how to solve complex public policy issues, including how to identify and assess options for action? Do you like developing policy proposals and then getting them enacted into law or regulation? If so, the MPP which emphasizes analytic and policy making competencies, is a good choice. We would be happy to work with you in figuring out which program is a better fit for your strengths and needs.Student LifeWhy Sacramento?No state and few nations face the complexity and consequence of policy choices made and implemented in California. The campus, located just 10 minutes from the State Capitol, is at the epicenter of the offices of state, federal and local agencies, plus those of non-profits and advocacy firms focused on public policy making and implementation. This proximity ensures that our students are able to analyze, observe and engage in today's most critical issues.Sacramento is also an excellent place to live, work, and play! CareerBliss rated Sacramento 1st for Happiest Workers in Mid-Sized Cities. Bloomberg Businessweek placed Sacramento 2nd in their Top 10 Most Fun, Affordable U.S. Cities. Sometimes referred to as the City of Trees, Sacramento has the most canopy coverage of any major city in the United States, and comes in 3rd worldwide (MIT, Treepedia).Sacramento \u2014 The Capital City on the MoveIs on-campus housing available?University of Pacific\u2019s Sacramento campus offers a variety of on-campus housing opportunities. To be eligible for on-campus housing, you must have been accepted for enrollment. On-campus housing is extremely popular, interested students are encouraged to submit a request as early as possible.

In some cases, the undergraduate record is given different weight in relation to more recent employment or graduate work experiences since undergraduate work may have been completed many years ago. In addition, the admissions committee may offer full-time program applicants a seat in the part-time program if it is determined that the student may have better success in that program.Does McGeorge have an early decision or early admission deadline?No. However, we do have a priority deadline of Feb. 1.

Applicants are encouraged to reach out to college professors and administrators who have had the opportunity to assess their academic aptitude to write letters on their behalf.

We recommend you prepare for the LSAT and plan on taking it just once. If you are not satisfied with your score and think you can improve, you may want to consider retaking the LSAT. If you have multiple LSAT scores, with a five-point difference or greater, an LSAT disparity addendum is required with your application.Can I schedule an admissions interview at McGeorge?McGeorge does not offer interviews as part of the admissions process.

For more information on scholarships please visit ourfinancial aidandscholarshipweb pages.Although I have a strong G.P.A. for the last 60 units of my undergrad, I did poorly during my freshman year. Does this mean I won't get admitted?Grade trends such as this are evaluated often. Many students have uneven year-by-year undergraduate records. Evidence of overall academic strength is more important and, in general, superior performance in recent rigorous academic work is of significance, even if earlier grades were at a lower performance level. A short explanatory addendum to your personal statement is a good place to address such deficiencies.What factors does McGeorge consider when evaluating applications, and how are those factors weighed in the review process?The two largest components that are considered in predicting an applicant's relative success in law school are the grade point average and the LSAT score. Though these are useful predictors, they are not the only factors the admissions committee will consider when reviewing your application. McGeorge reviews each application in its entirety, considering every component. The admissions committee will take into consideration grade trends, leadership, volunteer and work experience, the personal statement, any addenda the applicant submits, and any information included in letters of recommendation. All components assist the admissions committee in determining an applicant\u2019s academic potential and propensity for success in law school.How much is JD tuition?Tuition (subject to Board of Regents approval) for the 2023-2024 academic year is $59,080 for the full-time program and $39,283 for the part-time program.We expect a 3% increase in tuition for the 2024-2025 academic year.\u00a0Please note that there are additional required fees and summer school is charged on a per unit basis;visit our tuition pagefor more information.How do I find out more about financial aid?For complete information on deadlines, options and the financial aid process, please visit thefinancial aid web page.

Dugoni School of Dentistry?A: No, all IDS applicants (first-time or returning) must submit a CAAPID application directly with the American Dental Education Association (ADEA).Q: I have previously submitted an application directly to the Dugoni School of Dentistry. Do I need to submit a CAAPID application?A: Yes, all returning applicants must submit a CAAPID application with American Dental Education Association (ADEA).Q: I applied last year and had to submit a PDF file of supplemental documents. Are these materials still required?A: No, all materials including transcripts, letters of recommendation, and test scores should all be sent through your CAAPID application. IDS Admissions will no longer accept duplicate or supplemental documents manually.Q: What happens when I submit my CAAPID application with ADEA on the deadline date?A: Applicants are highly encouraged not to wait until the deadline to submit their CAAPID application. Applicants who do apply on or near theADEA/CAAPID deadline\u2014Friday, June 9, 2023, 11:59 pm Eastern Time, must take full responsibility to fulfill ADEA's application requirements by filing an online CAAPID application, paying the processing fee, and providing all test scores, letters, and other documentation required prior to the deadline. It is also important to understand that ADEA may take more than 2 weeks before releasing the CAAPID application to Pacific, so the earlier you can submit your application, the better.Q: I see that I can still submit my CAAPID application to other programs, but I am not able to submit it to the Dugoni School. Is this normal after the application deadline?A: Yes, many programs using the CAAPID application service all have their own deadlines and processes. The Dugoni School of Dentistry has set their deadline for Friday, June 9, 2023, by 11:59 pm Eastern Time, though your CAAPID application will remain active until early February 2024. During this time, you may also submit your CAAPID applications to other programs. Our deadline is final, and no exceptions or extensions will be made. We always encourage applicants to be familiar with all dates and deadlines associated with other schools that they are planning to apply to.Important Note:The new ADEA Program Finder toolis now live (as of January 2023) for ADEA CAAPID programs! Check out this page for more information on programs you are looking into applying for this cycle.Q: I paid my supplemental application fee of $100 but was not able to submit my CAAPID application in time. Can I still be considered for admission?A: No. We are not able to review materials submitted without a valid and complete CAAPID application submitted by the deadline in June.Application FeeQ: Can I pay the application fee online with a credit card?A: Applicants will pay the $100 (USD \u2014 non-refundable) application fee online with a credit card (American Express, Discover, Mastercard or Visa). Please be sure to provide all requested payment information, including your CAAPID #.Q: Is the supplemental application fee different from the fees I already paid through CAAPID?A: Yes. You are required to pay all ADEA CAAPID fees associated with your application to each dental school. The Dugoni School\u2019s separate application fee of $100 can be paid through\u00a0the school's online payment portal.Q: I\u2019ve paid my $100 supplemental application fee but wasn\u2019t able to submit my CAAPID application. Is the application fee refundable?A: No, unfortunately there are no refunds given for the $100 fee. We recommend candidates wait until submitting their completed CAAPID application successfullybeforepaying the Dugoni School\u2019s $100 fee.Q: Do you accept fee waivers from the ADEA Fee Assistance Program?A: No, fee waivers only pertain to fees associated with ADEA. Our application fee is required for processing applications.Dental Curriculum Vitae (CV)Q: Do I need to copy the same format of the provided sample dental CV?A: We strongly recommend using the sample CV as a guide to ensure the admissions committee thoroughly reviews your experiences and accomplishments. Applicants should provide information about their dental experience from the time of earning their initial dental degree to present (unless noted otherwise). It is recommended that you replicate the sample CV and classify your dental experience by International and/or United States / Canada.Q: Can I submit updates to my dental CV after my CAAPID application is submitted?A: No, the IDS Admissions office will not be accepting any application updates after the CAAPID application is submitted. Make sure to submit your application with as much information on your file as possible, to ensure the admissions committee has all the information needed to make an informed decision regarding your application.Q: What if I do not have anything to include under one of the categorical heading options (i.e., I never received an advanced degree)?A: If you do not have any information to provide under a specific category, you can leave out that section header.Q: When I am logging my research experience, do I also log any associated publications I have completed with the research section, or do I also log publications in the section for publications (presentations, etc.).A: If you published any writing during your research experience, you would log your total research hours for each project in the research section AND log the publication you were a part of under the publications section.Q: How would I list conferences that I have attended on my dental CV?A: If you arepresentingat a conference, list the presentation itself under \u201cpresentations.\u201d If youattendedthe conference, this would likely go under Continuing Education, if CE credits were earned at this conference. If no CE credits were earned by attending the conference, do not include it on your CV.Q: Should I include any experiences, dental or non-dental related, from the time prior to receiving my initial dental degree?A: No, the committee will only score and consider experiences that are gained AFTER the receipt of your initial dental degree.Note:any internships, preceptorships, etc. that are part of your dental degree graduation requirements should not be included on the dental CV, as they are part of your degree requirements.Q: When I am listing my Continuing Dental Education (CDE) credits, do I list a summary of the hours, or should I list every course that I have taken?A: We prefer and recommend that applicants list ALL CDE related courses, both online and in-person on their dental CVs. Please make sure to still sort them by International CDE courses and US/Canada CDE courses, as with all section categories on your CV.Q: I have applied in a previous application year, and in the past I had to include all my other documents and files with my dental CV and send it as a PDF directly to admissions. Is this still required?A: No, we no longer ask for or accept additional files outside of the CAAPID application. There is a section on the CAAPID application, where you can upload additional files, including your Dental CV.Applications will not be considered complete without uploading your Dental CV.Letters of EvaluationQ: What if I have dental experience I\u2019d like to include in my application that was completed before my dental degree? Can I put it on my CV?A: The CV is geared towards getting information on experiences after dental school only (some sections allow items from during dental school). However, you will also be logging experiences directly on your CAAPID application. In the CAAPID experiences section, you may include any experiences gained prior to your dental degree in this area.Q: How many letters of recommendation are required for admission?A: Three letters are required, submitted through your ADEA CAAPID Application. Otherwise known as \u201cEvaluations,\u201d all three letters should be written in English (or translated to English by a certified translator) and should be as recent as possible written, signed, and dated no later than January 2020.Q: Who should I ask to write these letters for me?At least two of these three letters must be written by either U.S. or international dental professionals (dentists, dental school faculty, etc.) with whom you have worked or studied from. A letter from a dental school dean is not required.Q: What instructions should I give my evaluators to ensure that the letters are submitted properly?A: Please have your evaluators follow the following guidelines when submitting their letters:Provide the letter on company or school letterhead.Evaluators need to include theirname, phone number, email,andmailing addresseither directly on the letter or through the CAAPID submission process.Letters must be hand signed by the evaluator. Digitally signed letters will not be accepted.Q: When do the letters need to be submitted by?A: No later than the UOP Application Deadline in June. For the 2023-24 Application Cycle, the deadline to submit letters through ADEA CAAPID is Friday, June 9th, 2023, by 11:59 PM Eastern Time.Q: What if my evaluator sent in their letter to CAAPID without a physical signature or letterhead?A: If we find that a letter is missing a requirement such as a signature or letterhead while processing applications prior to the June application deadline, IDS Admissions will email the applicant with specific instructions and deadlines to have the evaluator correct the error, and to re-send the letter to us directly atids@pacific.edu. Only letters of correction requested by the Office of Admissions will be accepted outside the ADEA CAAPID application. Failure to correct errors in a timely manner can cause your file to be incomplete after the June deadline passes.Q: Do I need to submit letters of evaluation to the Dugoni School of Dentistry when I already submitted them to ADEA CAAPID?A: No, ADEA CAAPID will ask for up to three letters when you are completing your application. Please submit your evaluations that we require through ADEA CAAPID as instructed on your application.Q: To whom should the letters of evaluation be addressed?A: The letters of evaluation should be addressed to the IDS Admissions Committee.Q: May I submit more than 3 letters of evaluation to Pacific?A: No. We will not accept additional letters of recommendation past the three required by ADEA CAAPID. Additional letters sent to us directly will not be considered for your application.Q: What happens if my letter is not written in English?A: Applicants will be required to provide the letter in its original language along with an English translation from a certified translator.National Board Dental Examination (NBDE1&2 or INBDE)Q: Can I apply to the IDS program now and take the NBDE 1&2 or INBDE later?A: No, applicants must take and pass NBDE 1&2 or INBDE by application deadline and request ADA Department of Testing Services to submit results to ADEA.Q: Will my application be considered with a NBDE score of 74 (just one point from 75) or a Fail result to NBDE or INBDE?A: No, applicants who earned a score less than 75 or a Fail result, are encouraged to retake the NBDE 1&2 or INBDE to earn a Pass result; otherwise, the application will be considered incomplete and will not be reviewed by the IDS Admissions Committee.Q: Does the Admissions Committee consider the number of attempts when reviewing these submissions?A: The IDS Admissions Committee evaluates applications holistically, so the number of attempts would not disqualify an applicant from applying to our program.Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)Q: Am I required to take the TOEFL?A: Yes, all applicants, including U.S. citizens, are required to take the TOEFL. Request ETS to provide the TOEFL score report to ADEA (institution code \u2013 B451) with scores earned between January 2021 to present. An internet-based test (iBT) total score of 92 or higher is required.Q: Am I exempt from taking the TOEFL when I have earned a degree from a U.S. college/university that did not require me to take a TOEFL since my English is good/proficient?A: There are no exemptions. All applicants are required to take the TOEFL.Q: Can I apply to the IDS program now and take the TOEFL later?A: No, it is recommended to wait for the TOEFL result\u00a0before sending the PDF email attachment with all the supplemental documents.Q: Will my application be considered with a TOEFL internet-based test (iBT) total score of 91?A: No, applicants who earned less than the iBT total score of 92 are encouraged to retake the TOEFL; otherwise, the application will be considered incomplete and will not be reviewed by the IDS Admissions Committee.Q: Do you accept MyBest scores?A: No, MyBest scores will not be considered. IDS Admissions will only accept TOEFL scores from a single test date.Q: I have taken the TOEFL exam more than once. How does the IDS Admissions Committee consider multiple TOEFL scores?A: We do not have a limit on the number of TOEFL attempts taken. However, the Admissions Committee will only considerthe most recent score. I.e., if you get a lower score when you retake the TOEFL, the Admissions Committee will consider that new score, and the higher first score will be voided.Q: Will you accept TOEFL retakes that are taken after application submission?A: Yes if we receive the TOEFL scores before the June deadline. We will include the new scores for the committee\u2019s review. After the deadline, we will not consider the new TOEFL scores.Dental Diploma/CertificateQ: Can I apply with a medical degree?A: Only applicants who have earned a dental degree (BDS, DDS, DMD, Odontology, Stomatology) are eligible to apply to the IDS program.Q: Can I apply with a provisional dental degree?A: IDS Admissions do not accept provisional dental degrees nor offer any exceptions to this dental degree requirement.

Applicants with a grade average of 0 \u2013 1.99 will not be eligible to apply to the IDS program.Q: Do you accept any other agency\u2019s evaluations?A: IDS Admissions will only accept ECE course-by-course evaluation with a U.S. grade average of 2.00 \u2013 4.00.Q: What if I discover an error was made on my grade average calculation?A: Corrected grade average from the ECE course-by-course evaluations will be considered as long as they are received by us before the June deadline. If ECE provides an additional grade average score (i.e., best result or comprehensive), Pacific will only consider thecomprehensive grade average.Financial Aid/ScholarshipsQ: As an international student, am I eligible to apply for federal financial aid?A: This depends on your current citizenship/visa status. Only students who are U.S. citizens, U.S. permanent residents or eligible non-citizens are eligible to apply for federal financial aid.Q: Does the Dugoni School of Dentistry provide any kind of scholarships for the applicants?A: The Dugoni School of Dentistry has limited institutional scholarships; however, there is no guarantee of receipt of these funds.

The committee reviews only the most recent DAT scores provided.For instructions on how to schedule a date for the DAT, please visit theAmerican Dental Association (ADA)website.Q: Are there particular courses that would best prepare me for dental school?A: The Admissions Committee encourages every student to develop his or her course of study in conjunction with the college or university predental advisor. If a school does not have a predental advisor, the student should consult faculty members in the chemistry and biology departments to select courses that meet the intent of the predental requirements. We recommend you select courses that extend the content of biomedical sciences, such as anatomy, histology, biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology.Q: What level of performance is the Admissions Committee looking for in my academic history?A: Many of our successful applicants completed three or more terms of full-time study at a college within the last three years. Full-time study is defined as four or more courses per term. In each term, three of the four courses should be predental science courses approved for biology majors. Applicants should achieve a B or better in each course; no D, W, F or I grades. Our incoming class grade point averages (GPA) are 3.6 overall and 3.5 science.Q: Are there elective courses that would help prepare me to be a good dentist?A: To develop your doctor/patient relationship skills, we recommend a course in journalism, public speaking, debate, interpersonal relationships, or drama.To prepare you for managing your own business, we recommend accounting for small business, marketing for the small business, consumer behavior or economics courses.To enhance your hand skills, we recommend course work in mechanical drafting/drawing, jewelry making, sculpting or ceramics.Q: Does Pacific require a secondary application?A: No. You need only to file anAssociated American Dental School Application Service (AADSAS)application.

By May, all applicants will be notified by mail as to the final decision on their application.Q: What are the selection factors for an interview at Pacific?A: The Admissions Committee carefully considers each applicant's scholastic record, scores on the DAT, AADSAS essay, letters of evaluation, evidence of manual dexterity (including the perceptual ability portion of the DAT) and other personal attributes and qualities as well as demonstration of his or her understanding about a career in the dental profession.Applicants who appear to meet the requirements will be invited to the dental school in San Francisco for an interview with one or more members of the Admissions Committee. During the interview the applicant's interest in dentistry, future plans, maturity and other personal qualities needed for successful work with patients are assessed. In addition, applicants will participate in an orientation seminar, meet informally with current dental students and tour the school. Applicants who are offered the opportunity to enroll must complete planned coursework at a specified performance level.The Executive Admissions Committee reserves the right to override admissions recommendations made by faculty interviewers.Q: If I have applied to your dental school in previous years, am I guaranteed admission next year?A: No. Our dental school has one of the largest applicant pools in the country. This year more than 2,700 individuals applied for 140 positions.Unfortunately, the Admissions Committee had to deny admission to many qualified applicants due to limited class size.

See our full listing ofupcoming events.Do you offer one-on-one advising sessions/transcript review sessions?Unfortunately, due to the volume of applicants, and in order to ensure fairness in the evaluation of applicants, we are unable to meet individually with applicants. The information sessions offer an excellent opportunity for applicants to interact with the faculty and learn more about the profession. The program is also happy to correspond with you via email (preferred) or telephone if you have questions or need further information.Is there a preferred undergraduate major?We do not have a preferred undergraduate major and your undergraduate major will not affect your application.Is there a preference between a community college or four-year institutions for completing prerequisite coursework?There is no preference as to where you complete your prerequisites.

However, it does strengthen your application if there is some recent coursework.My bachelor\u2019s degree will not be completed until after the admissions cycle closes. However, I have completed all other prerequisites. Can I still apply?No. In order to meet all prerequisites, your degree must be awarded and appear on an official transcript at the time of application submission.Do I need to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE)?The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is not required, but applicants can elect to submit their scores at the time of testing using the designated institution (DI) code 7363. If you have previously taken the GRE and would like to submit your scores, University of the Pacific\u2019s GRE code is 4065. Scores are valid for 5 years perETSwebsite.How do you calculate my GPA?We use CASPA calculated GPAs, specifically the Overall Total GPA and Overall Science GPA. We will not recalculate GPAs for admissions purposes. It is therefore very important that all grades have posted and appear on your transcript prior to submitting your application.Learn more about how CASPA calculates GPAs.Are pass/fail courses acceptable for prerequisite courses?Pass/fail courses are acceptable to meet prerequisite courses if taken at an accredited US institution. Please note, pass/fail courses do not affect your GPA per CASPA\u2019s GPA calculation policy.Learn more about how CASPA calculates GPAs.Is there a minimum grade for prerequisite courses?The minimum allowable grade for prerequisite courses is a C-.

Note: AP/CLEP credits cannot be used to meet science prerequisites.If AP credits are lumped together on your transcript without course credit equivalencies (i.e. AP credits \u2013 12.0), please request a letter of explanation for AP credits from your university\u2019s Registrar. Once obtained, please upload the letter to CASPA to accompany your application materials. The letter must be on university letterhead or bear the seal of the institution.I have vertebrate (or another type of) anatomy. Will that satisfy the Human Anatomy requirement?No, we require Human Anatomy to satisfy the Human Anatomy prerequisite requirement.I have one composition class and one literature class. Do I need to take another composition class to satisfy the English requirement?No. As long as you have successfully completed at least one composition course, we will accept a literature, writing-intensive, or composition course to complete the requirement. AP/CLEP credit (if recorded on a transcript) may also be used to fulfill the English requirement.I am an international medical graduate. Which services do you accept for academic evaluation?We will only accept the World Education Services (WES) evaluation of foreign training. CASPA will also accept the WES evaluation of transcripts so this is the required service for our program. For more information visitwww.wes.org.Is the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) required? If so, what is the cut-off score?Please consult theTOEFL flowchart. The TOEFL cut off score is 100. TOEFL scores are valid for two years after the test date perETSwebsite. IELTS scores can be substituted for the TOEFL exam with a cut-off score of 7.0.CASPA allows up to 5 letters of recommendation, but your program only requires 2. If I submit 5, will they all be considered, or will you pick only 2 to read?Our admissions committee considers the letters of recommendation as a whole, so if you have more than 2, they will all be considered. It is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage to your application if you have more than the 2 required letters.Health Care ExperienceWhat type of health care experience will satisfy the health care experience requirement?We do not consider one type of clinical experience greater than another (i.e. experience as an RN is not more valued than that of a medical assistant). Experience may be paid or unpaid. We do not accept hours accrued for academic credit or as part of a training or experiential learning course/program.Examples of experiences that typically satisfy the HCE requirement:Athletic TrainerCertified Nursing Assistant (CNA)* Must be licensed.ChiropractorChiropractor AssistantDental HygienistDieticianEKG/EEG TechnicianEmergency Medical Technician (Basic or Intermediate)Emergency Room TechnicianMedical Assistant (Back Office)Medical ScribeMilitary Medic or CorpsmanNurseOccupational TherapistOccupational Therapy Assistant or AideOphthalmic/Optometric Assistant / TechnicianParamedicPharmacistPhlebotomistPhysical TherapistPhysical Therapy Aide/Tech/AssistantRadiological TechnicianRehabilitation TechnicianRespiratory TherapistSurgical Technician / AssistantUltrasound TechnicianExamples of experiences that typically do not satisfy the HCE requirement:Basic Caregivers & CompanionsBehavioral Health TechniciansBilling / InsuranceCaring for family membersCase Management, Records ManagementClinical Care ExtenderDietary Aide / ClerkGreeterHealth EducatorsLifeguardingMedical Translation / InterpretingMedical Transcription / Virtual ScribePatient NavigatorPatient TransporterPersonal TrainersPharmacy Clerks (Retail)ShadowingVeterinary care or other experiences working with animalsExperiences mainly administrative in natureAny experience accrued for academic credit or as part of a training or experiential learning course/programAt a minimum, the applicant's clinical experience should include one of the following:Collecting of, and/or reporting in the patient's chart, data necessary to establish a diagnosis or evaluate the progress of the patient's treatment plan;Assisting a health care worker in the performance of diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures;Under the supervision of a health care provider administering or dispensing medications;Other work involving direct patient contact and interaction.HCE credit is determined by the duties you performed, not solely by job title. It is imperative when completing your application to include a detailed description of your job duties to ensure the Admissions Team can accurately determine HCE applicability.If you are not sure if your experience will satisfy the requirement please contact the program atPAprogram@pacific.edufor further clarification.Should I still apply if I won\u2019t have 1,000 hours by the application deadline?The program requires a minimum of 1,000 hours of health care experience (accrued at the time of application). If you will not be able to accumulate at least 1,000 hours of health care experience by the deadline, then you should wait to apply during a future cycle. The program does not project hours up to our application deadline or matriculation, but rather considers the number of hours accrued at the time you submit your application.Application Submission & CASPAI made a mistake/omission on my application. I have now fixed the issue. Can you re-evaluate my application with the new information?Unfortunately, we use the CASPA application, as submitted and verified, to make admission decisions. We know the application is a snapshot in time, however, we must have stability in applications to make an \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison between applicants. Accordingly, we will not accept any changes to submitted and verified CASPA applications within a given application cycle. Thus, it is imperative that applicants review their applications thoroughly prior to submission.Can I submit supplemental application materials to the program?We do not have a supplemental application. Please do not submit documents directly to the program unless requested. We use the Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) program to keep all of your application documents in one secure online location. We encourage you to make sure to include all pertinent information in your initial CASPA application, as it is sometimes difficult to add documents later.My grades have now posted for courses that were in progress when I submitted my CASPA application. Can you recalculate my GPA?We use CASPA-calculated GPAs, specifically the Overall Total GPA and Overall Science GPA. We will not recalculate GPAs for admissions purposes. It is therefore very important that all grades have posted and appear on your transcript prior to submitting your application.All applicants who are offered a seat in the class will have their GPAs verified prior to matriculation to ensure that any non-prerequisite, in-progress courses, maintained a GPA, in both overall total and overall science calculations, above the required 3.0.Learn more about how CASPA calculates GPAs.Can I use CASPA\u2019s professional transcript entry service for my coursework?Yes. Please keep in mind that the professional transcript entry service requires additional time once you have submitted your application. If you utilize the service, plan to submit your application early enough to allow for the extra steps to be verified by our deadlines. \u00a0For more information about professional transcript entry, please refer to theCASPA Help Center.What is your timeline for reviewing applications, interviewing candidates, and selecting a class?We will review each application once it has been verified by CASPA and delivered to our program. CASPA states that the average application is verified within 2 weeks. Until it is verified by CASPA, our program is unable to provide you with any information regarding the status of your application. Upon CASPA verification, your application will undergo a complete, holistic review, beginning with verification of prerequisite completion. The application review process can take several weeks; however, it is not uncommon to receive a response within a few days.Qualified applicants will be invited to interview for a position in our program. Interview invitations are extended throughout the admissions cycle at a rate determined by the quality of our applicant pool each year. Interviews take place from July through September, with our final class selection taking place no later than Oct 1.What is the application submission deadline? Do my transcripts need to be verified by CASPA by the deadline?Applications must be submitted and in \u201ccomplete\u201d status by 11:59 p.m. EST ( 8:59 p.m. PST) on Aug. 1. A complete date is given when an application is e-submitted and all transcripts, payments, and at least two letters of reference have been received by CASPA and attached to the application. Note: CASPA states that the average application will be verified within 2 weeks. It is up to the applicant to ensure that their application materials are submitted in a correct and timely manner so that the application can quickly move through the verification process. Exceptions are not granted, so be sure to plan ahead to meet the posted deadlines.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bI have substantial volunteer hours that I completed in high school. Should I include these hours in my application?We only review volunteer hours earned post-high school. Please do not include hours earned during or before high school.InterviewsDo you have rolling admissions or offer early acceptance?All seats will be offered after the final interviews have been conducted. Due to our admissions timelines and in fairness to all applicants, we do not offer early admission.I was invited for an interview. What will the format of the interview day look like?The interview day lasts several hours and consists of an orientation, panel interview, and group interview. Tours of the program facilities and campus are included.I was invited for an interview. Can I bring updated materials (r\u00e9sum\u00e9, transcripts, letters of recommendation, etc.) to the interview?We use the Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) program to keep all of your application documents in one secure online location. We will not accept any documents on the interview day. Please do not submit documents directly to the program unless requested.I received a notification that I will not be offered a seat in the class this cycle. What can I do to improve my application for the next cycle?With more than 2,500 applicants for 45 seats, the applicant pool is deep and competitive and most programs do not have the time or staffing to give applicants who did not meet their criteria feedback about how to improve their application. We do not offer specific advice for applicants; however, if you look at the average matriculant to PA school in 2019, you can get an idea of what a competitive applicant looks like. The average matriculant had a BS degree in biology or health sciences, a GPA of 3.58, 3,240 hours of health care experience involving direct patient care, and variable volunteer work. (PAEA, 2019). Every program has certain things they are looking for, so there is not any solitary thing to focus on, but you will want to be competitive with those that are matriculating and pay attention to the program mission. You may also want to consult our matriculant data on thePA Program Datapage.Is there an alternate list for acceptance?With a robust and highly competitive applicant pool, we cannot accept every qualified applicant. During class selection each September, the admissions committee selects applicants for the alternate list. Applicants can expect to be notified of their alternate status no later than Oct. 1. The alternate list is ranked; however, the rankings are not public and will not be shared. Alternates can expect to be offered a seat in the class up until Feb. 1.Back to Physician Assistant StudiesStockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

However, you must have pre-requisites completed ten weeks prior to the start of class.Back to topDo all prerequisites have to be completed within a specific time frame?No, but it is desired that all prerequisite courses (in particular, the human anatomy and human physiology prerequisites) have been completed within the past seven years of your application date.Back to topCan the prerequisite communication courses be substituted?No, these are requirements set by the Board of Registered Nursing and are verified when ELMSN graduates submit their documentation for licensing exam eligibility. Only courses titled Group Communication, Verbal Communication, Written Communication or closely related titles will be accepted. It is not enough for a course to have an \u201cextensive writing or communication component\u201d or be too specific in one form of writing. All applicants, regardless of their academic or professional background, must complete each of the prerequisites to be considered for admission to the program.Back to topCan one course satisfy multiple prerequisites?No, each course may only satisfy one prerequisite.Back to topHow can an applicant fulfill the Human Development Across the Lifespan course requirement?The course may be offered through a human development or psychology department but must touch upon human development from birth until death. This course requirement can be fulfilled by a series of courses which combined are worth at least three semester units.Back to topIs there a certain grade requirement for the prerequisite courses?Yes, applicants must receive a cumulative GPA of3.2or better in all prerequisite coursework. It is best practice to have a B or better in all nursing prerequisites.Back to topCan prerequisites be waived?No, applicants must complete all prerequisites, regardless of their prior academic or professional backgrounds.Back to topIs AP Credit Accepted?No, we do not accept AP credit in place for prerequisite coursework.GeneralWhat degree will I earn?Master of Science in Nursing (MSN).Back to topHow long is the program?Full time for 24 months and 90 units (six consecutive semesters). The program averages 15 to 16 units per semester.Back to topWhen does the program begin?The ELMSN program admits 40 students twice a year. Admitted students begin in August or January. Applicants must submit their applications approximately eight months in advance.Back to topCan I apply if I want to be a family nurse practitioner but I am not a registered nurse?Prospective students first need to be a registered nurse before applying to a family nurse practitioner program. One option is to complete a Master\u2019s Entry Program in Nursing. Graduates are eligible to apply to a Post-MSN family nurse practitioner certificate program upon licensure or apply to a DNP FNP program.Back to topDoes the ELMSN prepare students to become a licensed registered nurse?Yes, the program provides California Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) approved coursework and clinical experiences needed in preparation for the National Council Licensing Examination (NCLEX) to practice as a registered nurse. Upon completion of the entire ELMSN program, students are eligible to take the NCLEX exam to become licensed registered nurses.Back to topWhat is the difference between the Bachelor of Science in Nursing and the Master\u2019s Entry Program in Nursing (ELMSN)?The Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree is an undergraduate program that allows students to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree as they prepare to become registered nurses. The ELMSN is a graduate program designed for individuals who already earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in a different field and seek to transition into clinical nursing and leadership roles.Back to topWhat is the difference between MSN and ELMSN?Both programs are graduate nursing programs, however, MSN is designed for students who already earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in Nursing and seek to further their nursing education. ELMSN is designed for individuals with a bachelor\u2019s degree in another discipline who seek to transition into nursing.Back to topHow is ELMSN program unique?The curriculum incorporates the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (2021) New Educational Standards (Domains). As healthcare is shifting to a community-based model, students will complete coursework in epidemiology, population health, advanced pharmacology and a Public Health Certificate coursework. In addition, the program curriculum was based on best practices as identified through nursing education research. Some of the highlights of this approach are case-based, problem-based learning, and simulation. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, ELMSN graduates are in the highest demand of all nursing programs and earn the highest salaries upon graduation. Also, California employment data (2019) of nursing graduates demonstrated a preference by employers for the ELMSN graduates.Back to topApplication informationStudents applying to ELMSN must complete a\u202fNursingCAS\u202fapplication and meet selection criteria. Following that process, qualified applicants who are verified by NursingCAS will be eligible for an interview conducted online or in person.How often are applications accepted?We accept applications twice a year for an August or January start.Back to topHow does one distinguish her or himself as a strong applicant?Given the competitive applicant pool, we recommend that each applicant submits a thorough and complete application prior to the deadline. Applicants' ability to articulate why they would like to become a nurse weighs heavily in the evaluation process. This should be clearly communicated in the essay.Back to topHow many letters of recommendation are required and from whom? Can letters of recommendation be sent directly to the school?We require three letters of recommendation. Please use recommenders who can speak to your academic performance, or your professional performance (e.g., faculty, employers). Hard copies are not accepted. Instead, submit your letters of recommendation through NursingCAS (PDF, Word document or by pasting text). References should be current within the last two years and should describe the applicant\u2019s strengths and potential as well as any concerns for completing the program and moving forward with a successful career in nursing.Back to topWhat should be included in the essays?The essays provide an opportunity to describe the applicant\u2019s reasons for pursuing a master's degree and for choosing the graduate nursing program at University of Pacific. The prompt will be posted in the NursingCAS application.Back to topDo I need experience in the healthcare field? Is experience preferred?No, it is not necessary to obtain acceptance into the ELMSN program. This program is designed for people without experience in healthcare. The admissions committee finds that students with degrees in other disciplines are often transferable to nursing. While experience is not required, exposure to professional healthcare and the ability to discuss your understanding of the RN role will strengthen your application.Back to topHow do I pay my application fee?All application fees require payments by credit card. Only cards with Visa and Master Card logos will be accepted. No checks, money orders or cash will be accepted.Back to topWhat if I do not have a Visa or Master Card?Payment may be made with a Visa or Master Card prepaid gift card which can be purchased at many major chain stores or online. Please be aware that the gift card must contain a balance sufficient to cover the application fee in one full payment.Back to topIMPORTANT:Your application and materials must have a \u201ccomplete\u201d (all materials received and pending verification) or \u201cverified\u201d status by the deadline. It is the applicants' responsibility to monitor the status of their applications and application materials on a regular basis. NursingCAS does NOT notify applicants if applications are incomplete or if documents are missing. Only applications and application materials with a \"complete\" or \"verified\" status by the deadline are considered for admission. For more information on application status, please visit the NursingCAS\u2019 Applicant Help Center.GPAWhat is the minimum GPA requirement?The minimum overall bachelor\u2019s degree GPA requirement is 3.0anda 3.2 in the last 60 units. The minimum nursing overall prerequisite GPA requirement is 3.2.Back to topHow do you calculate an applicant\u2019s bachelor\u2019s degree GPA? Do you use the NursingCAS calculation?We use the overall GPA fromallcollege coursework calculated by NursingCAS based on the coursework reported by the applicant and verified with transcripts by NursingCAS.Back to topIf my overall GPA is below a 3.0 or my nursing prerequisite GPA is below a 3.2, am I still eligible to apply?No, all applicants must meet the minimum GPA requirements listed on the website.Back to topCan I retake classes to improve my GPA?An applicant\u2019s overall bachelor\u2019s degree GPA is final upon graduation. Taking additional courses or repeating courses after receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree does not affect a bachelor\u2019s degree GPA. However, Nursing prerequisite courses completed or repeated after graduation are calculated into the overall, last 60 unit, and nursing perquisite GPA.Back to topHow will repeated courses be calculated into my GPA?If the course was repeated at the degree-granting institution prior to graduation, the GPA calculation is determined by the school\u2019s grade-forgiveness policy.\u00a0Repeated prerequisites will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.Back to topWhat courses are used to calculate the prerequisite science GPA?Human Anatomy with lab (4 units), Human Physiology with lab (4 units), Microbiology or Bacteriology with lab (4 units), Statistics or Epidemiology (3 units), Nutrition (3 units), Sociology or Social Science (3 units), Communication (total 6 units), written and oral communication, and Psychology are all used to calculate your nursing prerequisite GPA.Back to topDoes the School of Nursing look at the entire undergraduate transcript or just the last 60 units of the undergraduate GPA?All college coursework is reviewed and calculated for an overall GPA. We also review and calculate the last 60 units.Back to topTime commitment and class scheduleCan students in the ELMSN program be part-time?No, this program requires a full-time commitment.Back to topWhere will the classes take place?Classes take place at the School of Health Sciences on Pacific\u2019s Sacramento campus.Back to topCan students work while enrolled in ELMSN?Be advised that the program requires a very intensive, full-time commitment from students. It is strongly recommended that you do not work or entertain other commitments outside of the program while enrolled.Back to topHow often are students in class during the program?Students can expect to be on campus full-time for the duration of the program in preparation for licensure. Most courses are held Monday through Friday, however, some courses and clinical experiences are held in the evenings or on weekends. For clinical rotations, students\u2019 often complete clinical rotations one to two days a week. In the final semester of the program, students will complete a precepted immersion experience, which requires you to be available Monday to Sunday to work two 12-hour shifts aligned with the assigned preceptor\u2019s schedule. This can include weekends and nights.Back to topWhat are the clinical experiences like?Clinical placements take place every semester for about 15-24 hours per week. Students complete clinical experiences in acute and ambulatory care, home and community. Students also participate in simulations (including high- and mid-fidelity patient simulators, standardized patients, task trainers and computer simulations) and are required to have reliable transportation to travel up to 50 miles for select rotations.Back to topBack to Nursing ProgramStockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

This program is being phased in over the course of three years, beginning with the class of 2016, students are required to complete (a.) either an Externship or Legal Clinic (3 units minimum), and (b.) a minimum of 8 units of simulation and practicum courses, including at least one simulation course and at least one practicum course.What is a Clinic or Externship?Through the Externship Program and Legal Clinics, students can get hands-on legal experience, putting the theory. They put the theory learned in the classroom into practice in an on-campus or hybrid clinic, or a field placement in a government agency or non-profit setting. Students in the on campus clinics represent real clients under careful supervision and all clinical and field placement students gain real-world legal skills.What is a Simulation Course?Simulation Courses (formerly referred to as Experiential Courses) are courses where students learn by doing, and in which the vast majority of instruction is devoted to professional skills and values required of practicing lawyers. Such courses enable students to integrate legal theory, professional skills, and professional identity.What is a Practicum Course?Practicum Courses are courses in which at least one-third of instruction is devoted to a professional skill or set of professional skills characteristically used by practicing lawyers. Practicum courses give students the opportunity to learn substantive law and also learn and appreciate the context in which that law is to be applied by working on lawyer-like projects on simulated legal matters.How will I know which courses qualify?By their very nature, these courses tend to be dynamic, cutting-edge offerings. From year-to-year the list of qualifying courses will change to reflect legal trends and interesting opportunities for McGeorge students. For example, in Spring 2014, we were able to offer a Practice Skills for Eminent Domain Lawyers simulation class taught by a partner from Downey Brand, in collaboration with the City of Sacramento. Each year, a list of qualifying courses is published online on theOffice of the Registrar page.May I take extra experiential courses?Space permitting, yes. Some students select both a clinic and a field placement and several practicums and simulations! Students report that the courses in the Experiential Curriculum prepare them well for the practice of law.What if I cannot meet the Clinic/Externship Requirement because of my job?Students who work full time (approximately 40 hours/wk) during normal business hours may request a waiver of the Externship/Legal Clinic portion of the Experiential Curriculum. Waiver requests will be reviewed by the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs or the Associate Dean and granted for good cause only. Waiver forms are available at the Office of the Registrar or the Office of Student Affairs.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

If you still have questions and concerns, contact Office of Graduate Admission.Current Pacific StudentsI'm an undergraduate student who wants to take a graduate level course. Is there any paperwork I need to fill out?Yes, you must first apply and be admitted to graduate school. Once admitted, you need to fill out the\u00a0Graduate Credit as an Undergraduate form\u00a0and submit it to the\u00a0Office of the Registrar. More information about\u00a0Graduate Credit as an Undergraduate can be found in theGraduate Catalog.I completed my bachelor's degree at Pacific. Do I need to submit my transcripts?If you are applying to a program through GradCAS or EngineeringCAS, you do not need to submit official Pacific transcripts- we will pull them internally. However, if you are applying through ATCAS, CASPA, CSDCAS, OTCAS or\u00a0PTCAS, then you will need to submit your official Pacific transcript- send your transcripts directly to Liaison Processing Center following the directions found in the application.ApplicationHow do I apply for an application fee waiver?Pacific alumni will receive a waived application fee waiver if applying through GradCAS or EngineeringCAS. Other CAS application systems (ATCAS, CSDCAS, CASPA, OTCAS, PTCAS)\u00a0have their own fee waiver process- learn more directly through the CAS. For those seeking a waiver due to financial hardship, please complete theApplication Fee Waiver Request (pdf)form and submit to gradadmission@pacific.edu.*This policy does not apply to those seeking admission to the Physical Therapy, Physician Assistant, Speech Language Pathology, Audiology, or Athletic Training programs.

Deferral of application is subject to program approval. Applications will only be deferred for up to one academic year. If a student does not begin coursework within one year of your original application for admission, they must submit a new graduate application for admission.

Are there any graduate teaching or research assistantship opportunities?Graduate assistantships available vary by program. Please contact the\u00a0program director\u00a0of your designated program for further details on graduate assistantships or other forms of financial aid.InternationalI'm an international student.

The degree is innovative and versatile and meant for professionals who seek the benefits of advanced training in legal reasoning and analysis. The degree enhances many professions and is ideal for business executives, entrepreneurs, policymakers, human resource and other professionals in today\u2019s economy. With so many businesses and industries being impacted by constantly changing laws and regulations, having knowledge and training in legal analysis can be advantageous in dealing with those everyday law-related issues.What can I do with an MSL degree?Because the law intersects with every industry in one way or another, it is very likely there is some aspect of your current role that could be enhanced with a MSL degree. Our MSL degree can also open career opportunities by allowing you to pivot your career toward the legal aspects of your field. For example, someone working in government affairs may take courses in lobbying, election law, and statutory interpretation. Individuals working with water and environmental issues may take courses in water resources law, environmental law, and water and environmental justice.Through our MSL coursework, you'll be better equipped to:Review and understand agreements such as contractsReview and draft proposed local, state, and federal laws and regulationsUnderstand and comply with regulatory requirements for specific industriesWork with attorneys and compliance officersWhat can I expect in terms of workload?Typical students will take six units in each semester. The general rule of thumb is that for every hour you spend in the \u201cclassroom,\u201d you can expect another 1.5 \u2013 3 hours of additional studying.How many courses must I complete in order to earn an MSL degree?Students must complete 26 credits. Please refer to the program\u2019s curriculum web page for a complete list of required and elective courses.Who teaches the classes?The classes are taught by a combination of McGeorge\u2019s full-time faculty members and highly qualified adjunct instructors.

We encourage you to view the faculty bios and send us an email atgraduatelaw@pacific.eduif you would like to connect with a McGeorge professor.What is required as part of the application?An application containing the following items is required: Official transcripts for all universities and colleges that you have attended, a resume or curriculum vitae, a personal statement, a writing sample, and one (required) or two (preferred) letters of recommendation. For more information, see MSL Admission.How are admissions decisions communicated to applicants?All decisions will be communicated to applicants via email. If you are admitted, a formal letter will be attached to the email.If I am accepted, how much time will I have to decide whether to enroll or not?Applications are accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis with a commitment required by April 1 (Fall start) or Nov. 1 (Spring start). The sooner you apply, the longer span of time you will have to make a decision that will work best for you. If an applicant submits their application materials after these dates, they will have two weeks from the time a decision is rendered to pay a seat deposit and commit to the program. Extensions to this two-week rule may be granted on a case-by-case basis.Is financial aid available?Yes, students may be eligible for financial aid.

McGeorge is a 100% Yellow Ribbon matching institution.Is it possible for my employer to cover all or part of the tuition?Applicants should check with their individual employers. Of the companies that do assist with tuition payments, some have a limit on the amount of tuition that can be covered in any given year.

The exact date that the academic terms begin varies from year to year so please reference the academic calendar.Do I need to participate in an orientation?An online orientation program is required for all program participants. Orientation will be available the week before the start of each semester.How are the online courses organized? Are they self-paced?Most courses within McGeorge online graduate programs are offered on a semester-long basis, with weekly modules. Although format may vary depending on the nature of the course, in most courses students should expect to be assigned new topics each week, with associated reading, lecture, discussion, exercises, quizzes, and other interactive activities. Individual topics that include a specific group of reading assignments, lectures, discussion, and exercises are called modules. Most courses will release new modules each Monday and allow one week for completion.Within the weekly modules, most McGeorge online courses will be primarily asynchronous. This means that students do not necessarily need to be online at the same time, and will have the flexibility to complete module activities at a time convenient to their schedules, as long as they complete the activities by the assigned, typically weekly, deadline. Some assignments, such as weekly discussion, may have mid-week deadlines. Some papers or projects may be assigned over several weeks or the course of a semester. To facilitate planning, all deadlines will be announced in the syllabus prior to the beginning of a course.What are the technical requirements for the online programs?Students need to have regular and reliable access to a computer and high-speed Internet. Note that mobile and tablet devices will not provide full access; students will need a laptop or desktop computer with a webcam.Are courses offered during the summer?There will be two units available over the summer. One of these units will have an optional residential requirement. While this is not required, we highly recommend your participation in the option residential opportunity.Is there a residential component?There is no requirement for an online student to come to our Sacramento campus. However, we highly recommend students to participate in the 1-unit hybrid summer course or come to campus for additional learning opportunities.I live in a state outside of California, can I apply?Per the Department of Education, we must be authorized to educate students in any particular state, therefore only students from pre-authorized states may participate in this program.

We want to make it easier on you! Here are answers to some of the questions we know you\u2019re wondering about.How do I pay for Pacific?The sticker price of attending any college or university can be jarring, but that\u2019s not what you\u2019ll be paying out of pocket. Most students who attend Pacific receive financial aid.\u00a0\u00a0If you submitted a FAFSA and added University of the Pacific, you were automatically considered for federal grants. If you qualify, they will be listed on your financial aid offer letter.If you haven\u2019t submitted your FAFSA, it\u2019s not too late! Apply atfafsa.ed.gov, and be sure to add Pacific \u2014 our school code is 001329. Apply even if you think you won\u2019t qualify \u2014 you might be surprised!When you applied to Pacific, you were automatically considered for a merit award, which is similar to a grant in that you don\u2019t have to pay it back. These are based on academic achievement.\u00a0If you qualify for work-study, it also will be listed on your financial aid offer letter. Work-study jobs not only provide income, but you\u2019ll gain experience and make connections! You can find work-study jobs using Handshake, Pacific\u2019s online job board.You might also consider taking out a student loan, but be sure to research the differences between federal and private loans. Students can qualify for federal loans regardless of income that was listed on the FAFSA and generally have better terms.Once you\u2019ve started attending Pacific, be sure to work with your academic advisor, who will help you plan your degree track so you can finish in the least amount of time possible (and thus pay less for college), if that\u2019s what you desire.For more information about the differences between grants, work-study and loans, and more financial aid resources, visitgo.Pacific.edu/FinancialAid. We hold financial aid webinars for admitted students most Wednesdays through May; be sure to check them out when you\u2019re on the financial aid website!What kind of jobs and internships can help me pay for Pacific?Many students choose to work part-time while attending\u00a0Pacific. Our Career Resource Center can help you find jobs and paid internships, or you can search for yourself on Handshake, Pacific\u2019s online job and opportunity board. It\u2019s easy and common for students to find work\u00a0on campus \u2013 get your resume drafted up and make an appointment atCareer Servicesto get started!Is the food actually good?Without exaggeration, the food on\u00a0Pacific\u2019s\u00a0campus is gourmet.\u00a0In cooperation with our food service provider, Bon Appetit, we strive to provide healthy, delicious meals for every diet using only the freshest\u00a0of ingredients.\u00a0At ourMarketplace, get made-to-order omelets, deli sandwiches, customized pasta and, of course, our famous breakfast burritos\u00a0and more.

We\u00a0get\u00a0it. Pacific has plenty ofhousing options, including Residential Learning Communities (check out ourInstagram Guideon those)!\u00a0Since you\u2019re a new student, you\u2019ll most likely be living in Grace Covell Hall\u00a0or The Quad Communities, which\u00a0both have\u00a0spacious rooms, communal lounges and well-maintained facilities.You can see more\u00a0about\u00a0our residence halls\u00a0on\u00a0our Instagram Highlight: Housing. Follow @pacificrlh for more updates regarding\u00a0housing and\u00a0learn more about\u00a0housing options and deadlines atgo.Pacific.edu/Housing.I\u2019m a first-generation college student.

Our campus provides resources specifically for first-generation students, like\u00a0First Generation Friday events, support groups atCounseling and Psychological Servicesand\u00a0student organizations dedicated to cultural and academic support.\u00a0We also have other academic\u00a0assistance services, like theStudent Writing Center, free\u00a0academic\u00a0tutoring\u00a0andcareer\u00a0services. And don\u2019t forget that your faculty advisor is there to make sure you graduate and that you are finding and pursuing your passions, so never hesitate to ask for help!What are the campus vibes?The\u00a0Pacific campus is notoriously friendly! In fact, it\u2019s nearly impossible to walk across our campus and not see a friend, classmate, professor\u00a0or staff member you love. Though our faculty and staff on campus are certainly the kindest and\u00a0most\u00a0dedicated people you\u2019ll find at any college, Pacific students truly make our campus a community of love and acceptance. You won\u2019t be competing against your classmates;\u00a0you\u2019ll be working alongside them, supporting each other through some of those tough college courses.

The granting of candidate status denotes a developmental program, which is expected to mature in accord with stated plans and within a defined time period. Reasonable assurances are expected to be provided that the program may become accredited as programmatic experiences are gained, generally, by the time the first class is graduated. Graduates of a class designated as having candidate status have the same rights and privileges as graduates of an accredited program.Learn more about ACEND\u00ae Candidacy for Accreditation.Are courses online or in-person?The majority of Pacific's MSCN courses are delivered via In-Person classroom instruction on our Sacramento campus, but also include some Hybrid courses (combination of In-Person and Online instruction). Students Supervised Clinical Practice Experience (SCPE) courses (NUTR 287A&B) take place at clinical education sites throughout California and some out-of-state facilities.Do I have to locate my own supervised experiential learning sites and/or preceptors?The MSCN program is responsible for identifying SPCE clinical education sites and preceptors and creates the rotation schedule for each student depending on site availability and student needs. It is not the responsibility of students to secure clinical placements. However, students are responsible for making arrangements for their housing and/or commuting plans to assigned clinical education sites, at the student\u2019s expense.Can I complete my supervised clinical practice experience (SCPE) rotations near my hometown?The MSCN program determines clinical education site placements for each trimester depending on site availability, preceptor availability, and student needs. While students\u2019 interests and residence location are elicited and reviewed, the MSCN program cannot guarantee that placements are near their residence. MSCN students can expect to be placed at clinical education sites throughout California. Out-of-state placements can also be considered and discussed with the student at facilities affiliated with Pacific. The program aims to provide adequate notice of placements, so students can make their arrangements for commuting or temporary housing, which is at the student\u2019s expense.Cost and Financial AidHow much does it cost to attend the MSCN program?Our program provides a helpful at-a-glance summary ofTuition and Estimated Expenses. Excluding living expenses which vary by student (housing/meals/transportation), our program expenses are approximately $71,057 for the 16-month program.What kind of financial aid is available?Financial aid packages are tailored to each individual's qualifications and program of study. Students will receive financial aid information once they are admitted and have accepted admission to the program. For answers to specific financial aid questions, applicants can contact the Office of Financial Aid department at 916.739.7158 orfinaid@pacific.edu.Are scholarships available?The MSCN Program has different scholarships available.

Students who apply after the priority deadline will be admitted on a space-available basis.Does the Pacific MSCN program participate in the D&D Digital Computer Matching process like dietetic internships?Our program does not participate in computer matching. Applications to the Pacific MSCN program are reviewed based on rolling admissions.Do I need to submit an application into DICAS (Dietetic Internship Centralized Application Services)?To apply to our program, you will submit an application inGradCAS\u2122. Our future education model program does not use DICAS.I am currently enrolled in an ACEND accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) and am still completing the final quarter/semester of my program. Can I still apply?Yes. DPD-students must submit a Declaration of Intent to Complete form signed by their DPD program director with their application in GradCAS.Do you offer admission in the spring semester?No. Due to the prescriptive nature of our program, we only admit students into the fall term.Do I need to submit official transcripts to GradCAS and Pacific when I apply?During the application process, you only need to submit official transcripts to GradCAS.Pacific MSCN Pre-Requisite CoursesI am a student from an ACEND accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD). Do I still have to enter my courses in the GradCAS Pacific MSCN Prerequisite Coursework section?Yes, both DPD-students and non-DPD students must complete the Pacific MSCN Prerequisite Coursework section in GradCAS.

Students cannot be concurrently finishing up prerequisite courses once the program has started.Is the Food Preparation course I\u2019ve already completed equivalent to Pacific\u2019s prerequisite Experimental Foods course?No. You must complete a food science course. This course is often called Experimental Foods (with lab) or Food Science (with lab) (4 units).Can I count my Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) course for both the Macronutrient and Micronutrient Pacific MSCN Course Prerequisites?This is a good question and often depends on the curriculum of your program \u2013 and whether you are completing quarter or semester courses. Different programs also call these courses different names (for example, MNT, human nutrition, advanced nutrition). In general, you can only apply one of your courses completed towards one Pacific MSCN prerequisite course (you can\u2019t list a single course to count as two prerequisites). You will need to carefully review the Course Descriptions and Course Objectives from your Course Catalog or class syllabi to determine which courses address macronutrient and micronutrient metabolism, and your department or major advisor may also be able to offer guidance on which of your courses best fulfill these prerequisites.

Don't worry. We have compiled a list of frequently asked questions just for that purpose.What is the Powell Match?The Powell Match was established through the transformative $125 million Powell Fund, a gift from the estate of Robert and Jeannette Powell. An astute businessman, Bob Powell appreciated an opportunity to leverage his philanthropy to inspire others, and with this program, he continues to do so. The Powells did not graduate from college themselves, yet served as members of the Pacific Board of Regents for many years and believed deeply in the value of a Pacific education. The Powell Fund matches new endowment gifts to Pacific, up to 1:1. More than $60 million is allocated for endowed scholarship matches and $25 million for endowed academic program matches.What is an endowment?An endowment is a permanent fund at the University established with contributions from donors that will be invested in perpetuity. Each year, a portion of the value of the fund is distributed to support the donor's purpose such as student scholarships or program support. Any earnings in excess of this distribution build the fund's market value. The University's current endowment spending policy is 4.0% of market value. Learn more about endowments.What types of endowments qualify for the match?Endowed funds that provide scholarships or academic support to our faculty and academic programs are eligible for the Powell Match Program. Examples of academic program endowments could include support for a specific department, a faculty position, or student learning opportunities such as academic competitions (e.g., forensics or trial advocacy), a lecture series or experiential learning programs. Examples of scholarship endowments could include gap grants, middle-income scholarships, merit scholarships or study abroad scholarships. From the Powell gift, more than $60 million is allocated for endowed scholarship matches and $25 million for endowed academic program matches.What types and size gifts are eligible for the Powell Match?Gifts of $50,000 or more to establish or enhance an endowment may be eligible to receive a Powell Match. Previously unmatched gifts made after October 1, 2012 may be considered for the match if an additional gift or commitment to the endowment is made. Gifts of cash, stock or other assets, including pledges of up to 5 years in length, qualify for 1:1 matching so long as the assets can be liquidated within a 5-year period.Do I have to make my gift in one payment?It is not necessary to make your gift all in one payment. However, neither the match nor the distribution will occur until the University has received the minimum $50,000. Payment schedules of various lengths may be established by the donor with a maximum duration of five years.How long do I have to fund my endowment?Once a gift and or pledge agreement is signed, the donor has a maximum of five years to reach the minimum required $50,000 to guarantee the Powell Match.Who is eligible for the match?Gifts from individual donors or couples, a group of individuals, family foundations or family owned businesses are all eligible to be matched by the Powell Fund.Can more than one person give to the endowment and be matched?Yes! One or more donors may give to an endowment.\u00a0Once that endowment reaches the $50,000 minimum, each and every additional gift will be matched on a quarterly basis for as long as matching funds are available.Does my employer's company qualify for the match as well?The Powell Fund will match both your gift and your company's matching contribution. Your company's match can also count toward the $50,000 minimum to qualify for the Powell Match. \u00a0So in effect, between the Powell Fund Match and a 1:1 match from your employer, your gift will be quadrupled.Example:$50,000 donor gift + employer match + $100,000 Powell Match = $200,000 endowmentDo planned gifts (deferred gifts) qualify for the match?Planned (deferred) gifts are not eligible for matching.When will the match occur?The match is made available after a gift or payments received toward a pledge total $50,000 or more. Your endowment is established in the quarter that the minimum $50,000 is received. The Powell Match portion is added at the same time.When will a new endowment start being used?If the endowment is funded by June 30, it will have a full distribution (currently at 4%) annually starting the fall after one year of investment. If the endowment has met the minimum after June 30, but prior to Dec. 31, the fund will have a half distribution (2%) starting the following fall and then a full (4%) annual distribution each subsequent year.Gift AmountPowell MatchTotal EndowmentPayment ReceivedDistributionEstimated Amount$50,000$50,000$100,000June 30, 2019Fall 2020$4,000$50,000$50,000$100,000Dec. 31, 2019Fall 2020$2,000Fall 2021$4,000How do I get started?Contact any University of the Pacific gift officer or Tod Davis, Powell Match Manager, at 209.946.2502 ortdavis@pacific.edu.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

Any Accelerated Honors Program applicant who is not admitted to that program will be given full consideration for the traditional JD program.Can I enroll in the Accelerated Honors Program after my first year is completed?No. Unfortunately, we have structured the curriculum to start in the spring semester of the Accelerated Honors Students' first year.Am I eligible to participate in study abroad programs as an Accelerated Honors Program student?Participating in a study abroad program is possible if you coordinate and plan accordingly to ensure you are meeting all of the requirements including the honors externship. To stay on track with the accelerated program, you will need to earn externship credits either during the year or in your two other summers. You can fulfill the regular experiential requirement of two capstone experiences over the course of your second and third year, but will need to make up the 7 units from the first summer with a combination of summer coursework or additional units during intersession or during the remaining semesters.Is my tuition covered during my summer honors externship?Yes, you are eligible for seven credit hours of free summer tuition. This can be used for the externship or for summer courses if you opt to study abroad after your first year.What GPA do I need to have to remain in the Accelerated Honors Program and how is it calculated?You must maintain a 3.00 GPA. GPA is calculated the same for AHP and regular JD students. For the first year, GPA is calculated based on the fall and spring semesters. For the second year, GPA is calculated based on any course taken during the summer before the second year and the fall and spring semesters of the second year. AHP students stay with the same entering cohort (of both regular JD and AHP students) throughout their time at McGeorge for GPA calculations and ranking.If your GPA falls below 3.0, you will need to meet with the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs or the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs to discuss your academic planning. If you improve your GPA during your second year and continue your progress towards completion of your JD a semester early, you may still graduate with AHP recognition as long as your final GPA exceeds 3.0. You may also be advised to discontinue the acceleration of your JD pursuit and graduate without the AHP designation.Where do most of your student's extern?Most students in the accelerated honors program will participate in an externship during the first summer after they commence law school. Externships will be full time for 10 weeks, and students will earn seven (7) credits. Example of externship placements include:Trial and Appellate Judges (state and federal)California Attorney General's Office (various divisions)Fair Political Practice CommissionFranchise Tax BoardDistrict Attorney's OfficePublic Defender's OfficeCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency \u2013 State Water Resources Control BoardCalifornia Department of Human ResourcesChildren's Law CenterCalifornia Department of Managed Health CareOther externship placements at non-profit and governmental agencies and organizations are also available and each student will be individually placed with consideration given to her or his area of interest.What is the benefit of participating in the Accelerated Honors Program?Accelerated Honors students will obtain their law licenses and be eligible to start practicing while their peers are preparing for the bar exam and therefore will begin working as attorneys or policy makers six months ahead of their peers in traditional three-year full-time programs.Because students in the Accelerated Honors Program participate in a free summer externship as part of the program, students in McGeorge's unique program save thousands of dollars.The most accurate way to compare the cost of attending McGeorge's Accelerated Honors Program is to discount the total cost of attendance by the free summer externship and the six months of income students will earn while their peers are studying for and taking the bar exam and waiting for their results.What is the purpose of the interview requirement?The interview provides an opportunity for both parties to ensure that your participation in this program will provide you all the opportunities for success available. Your application allows us to ascertain certain things about you, but an interview gives us an opportunity to talk with you about your experiences and determine whether the accelerated honors program is likely to be a good fit for you.Can I participate in mock trial, moot court, law review if I am a member of the Accelerated Honors Program?Like all McGeorge students, you will have the opportunity to earn a spot on our competition teams and/or law review. Our teams are nationally recognized and participating in them brings many opportunities to hone your craft and prepare you for your legal career. Because Mock Trial and Moot Court are designed to be year-long experiences, participation in these activities in your third year may be somewhat restricted.What if I start in the Accelerated Honors Program and change my mind?No problem. Depending on when you decide, you will be able to take a lighter load of classes.\u00a0Once you have elected to drop the AHP program, reentry is not possible.What are the eligibility requirements?Competitive students will have excellent academic credentials and distinctive life experiences to support successful completion of an accelerated JD degree. Students with a 157 LSAT score and a 3.3 or better undergraduate grade point average (UGPA) or a 156 and 3.5 or better UGPA presumptively will qualify for an interview. Students whose entrance credentials do not meet these prerequisites may qualify for an interview if their LSAT score and UGPAs are similar to these requirements and other aspects of their application justify further evaluation of their candidacy for the program.How does the Accelerated Honors Program give me a competitive advantage in the legal employment market?It helps in two ways. First, it puts you in the legal market sooner at a time when many other legal graduates are not job-searching. Second, your designation as an Accelerated Honors graduate is a mark of distinction that is likely to be impressive to future employers.How will potential employers know that I've completed the Accelerated Honors JD Program?As a new program, many employees will likely be unfamiliar with what it required to complete your degree faster than average. Placing this on your resume will undoubtedly open the door for you to discuss the nuances of the program and your ability to perform at such a rigorous academic level. You will also receive a certificate upon graduation and a designation on the commencement program. Will I select my own summer honors externship or will one be assigned to me? McGeorge will provide a list of opportunities, and the Director of Externships will work with you personally to find the best fit for you. We have a wide range of approved externship sites and will be able to find an experience to align with your interests and experiences.If I do not maintain the required GPA for the Accelerated Honors JD Program, how will I be integrated into the traditional JD program?Your integration with the three-year program will be seamless. You will have been taking classes with students in the three-year curriculum all along, and you will continue to do so if you end up in the traditional program.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

Dugoni School of Dentistry/The Center for Dental History and Craniofacial StudyCDHCS Policies & FAQDugoni Faculty & ResearchDepartmentsDepartments & ChairsLabs & CentersCareersPublicationsFaculty ResourcesAccess to CDHCS's collections is by special appointment only. For more information or to make an appointment, please emailpr@pacific.edu. Our complete policies and information can be found below.FormsApplications are available to students, faculty and other qualified professionals who wish to study the collection.Student Research Request FormFaculty Research Request FormVisiting Scholar Research Request FormPoliciesAccession and Deaccession of Human SkullsThe Atkinson Collection contains over 2400 accessioned human skulls, crania and mandibles. The majority of these individuals were acquired by Dr. Spencer R. Atkinson, an eminent orthodontist and craniofacial researcher, from 1919 to 1963. The University of the Pacific received his private collection in 1963. Subsequent additions have resulted from the dental school's human gross anatomy course during the early 1990s. More recently, a number of dental school alumni have donated skulls that they had purchased from biological supply houses during their dental school days.The Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study (CDHCS) makes every effort to ensure the continued security and preservation of donated skulls. Museum-quality cabinets and archival-quality trays house the Atkinson Collection. Specimens are handled minimally. During research studies involving examination of the skulls, curator assistance is mandatory.Acquisition GuidelinesSkulls donated to CDHCS must be recognizable as originally purchased from a biological supply house (i.e., specimen obviously prepared under laboratory conditions, with tissue removal, degreasing, and bleaching having resulted from standardized preparation techniques) or designated as non-Native American in ethnicity. Subsequent to receipt of a specimen, CDHCS staff may request a 30 day examination period if the specimen's derivation seems questionable.All acquisitions are to be outright and unconditional. Skull donations must be made with the understanding that, while the donor's preference may be taken into consideration, CDHCS staff will determine whether to accession the specimen into the main research collection or into the smaller teaching collection.Federal law prevents CDHCS from providing identification services or appraisal values for donated skulls. Donors are responsible for appraisals of value. Please contact biological supply houses or internet companies specializing in human osteological remains to determine approximate values. CDHCS is in no way affiliated with these organizations.Accession ProcessAccession RecordUpon receipt, the donation will be examined and described for accessioning purposes in an Accession Record. The donor will receive a copy of the Accession Record containing the following:Acquisition information: date received, CDHCS receiver's name, method of delivery of specimen to CDHCS;Donor information: donor's name, address, phone number and email address;Donation information: description of specimen, documentation relating to specimen, accession number and catalogue number(s) assigned;Donor Release statement: \"The objects listed above (and/or on attached list), when accepted by Museum Committee, become the sole and permanent property of Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study of the University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry. This gift is subject to no restrictions or conditions. Objects may be photographed or otherwise reproduced, exhibited or studied solely at the discretion of CDHCS. Determinations of value for tax purposes is the responsibility of the donor;\"Donor signature and date;Acceptance information (completed by CDHCS): indication of Museum Committee action to accept or reject donation;Name of recipient and date of return, if specimen is returned from CDHCS to donor.DeaccessioningAll donations to CDHCS are irrevocable upon the formal and physical transfer to CDHCS. Subsequent to accession, if a specimen is later deemed to fall outside CDHCS guidelines for acceptance, the donor will be contacted and the specimen deaccessioned and returned to the donor.Conditions Governing Skull LoansThe Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy and the P&S Comparative Anatomy skull collections are open to research by all qualified personnel. At the present time, all previous external loans have been recalled by University of the Pacific. Only limited future external loans will be considered. Loans will be assessed on their scientific merit, with priority given to maintaining the integrity of the collections.All loan requests must be submitted in writing on institutional letterhead and addressed to:CuratorAtkinson Collection, Center for Dental History and Craniofacial Study (CDHCS)University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry155 Fifth StreetSan Francisco, CA 94103A report of research findings must be provided to the Curator at the conclusion of a research loan regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.Imaging Restrictions: Loaned specimens may be CT scanned, photographed, X-rayed, videotaped or otherwise imaged only if separate permission is granted in advance.Research and Teaching LoansFaculty and Visiting Scholar Research LoansThe following information must be provided in research loan requests submitted by dental school faculty and by scholars and institutions outside of University of the Pacific:Explanation of why loan is necessary, or why doing research at CDHCS is impossiblePurpose of the loan, including a paragraph defining general research hypothesis and methodology and expected resultsNature of study procedure, including anatomical structures to be examined or measuredMethod of examination or measurement, including calipers, other osteometric devices, 3D digitizer, photographic equipment, X-ray equipment, CT scan equipment, or otherPrevious experience using calipers and 3D digitizer, if these instruments are to be used during your study.Faculty Teaching/Demonstration LoansA portion of the skull collections are available to faculty of the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry for teaching Selective classes or for short-term demonstrations in the classroom or laboratory setting. These are usually one- to two-day loans, but may be longer depending on need. On the day of the loan, the faculty member wishing to borrow specimens for class use purposes will be required to read and sign CDHCS's Faculty Teaching/Demonstration Loan form that contains the following: Instructor information: name, phone extension and e-mail address, class title and brief description, approx. class size; Specimen information: specimen catalogue number(s), juvenile or adult specimen, pre- and post-loaned condition of each specimen; Loan information: beginning and ending loan date(s), CDHCS loan approval and approval date, loan return date, brief summaries of specimen care and handling guidelines, and acknowledgement of conditions governing loans. The Faculty Teaching/Demonstration Loan form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Research Loans to StudentsLoans are not made to students. Students wishing to conduct research involving specimens from the skull collections must do so at CDHCS where the collections are housed.Exhibit LoansA completed AAM Standard Facility Report (available for purchase on the AAM website: (under \"Bookstore\") is required. The following information must be described in the exhibit loan request:Purpose of the loan, including exhibit type and location;List of specimen numbers or number and types of specimens requested;Explanation of why the specimens are needed for the exhibit; andA time framework, including shipping, photography, installation and exhibition dates.Traveling Exhibit LoansLoans are not made for traveling exhibit purposes.Commercial Use LoansThe borrowing of specimens for commercial or business for-profit use is limited to those projects that result in products of educational, research, or otherwise scientific value. No products incorporating or based on the borrowed specimens shall be produced without individualized contract document development and licensing approval by University of the Pacific. (See \"Commercial/Business Use and Images\" section for specific policy regarding images of specimens from the skull collections.) To initiate the loan procedure, the following information must be described in the commercial use loan request:Purpose of the loan, specifying all anticipated product development and product useList of specimen numbers or number and types of specimens requestedSpecific means of extracting product data from the specimens, including making casts, photographs, X-rays, CT scans, or other methodsLoan LimitationsTen specimens will be the maximum loaned at any one time. Loan requests subsequent to loan of the initial ten specimens will not be automatically granted and require submission of a new loan request. Rare specimens from the collections will not be loaned under any circumstances. Loans are not made internationally.Loan ConditionsBorrowerLoans are not made to individuals. Loans are made to non-profit, educational institutions for educational and scholarly purposes. If an individual researcher is affiliated with a museum, the loan agreement must be signed by the Director or Registrar of the receiving institution. If the individual researcher is affiliated with an academic department, the agreement must be signed by the department chairperson.Purpose of LoanSpecimens loaned by CDHCS may not be used for any purposes other than that agreed upon. Specimens may not be lent by the Borrower or individual researcher to a third party without the written permission of CDHCS.ScheduleAll non-teaching loans require a minimum of two months to process from the time that approval is granted and a final list of specimens is determined. Teaching loan requests should be submitted at least three weeks in advance.Loan Insurance for Loss/DamageThe borrower is responsible for the cost of insuring all borrowed specimens (and skull boxes used for transport) from the time they leave CDHCS until the time they are returned. Prior to releasing specimens for loan, CDHCS must receive from the borrower a memorandum and certificate of insurance from a fine arts insurance policy showing wall-to-wall coverage subject to standard exclusions with no deductible. Insurance coverage through the University of the Pacific is not available for purchase by the borrower.A borrower who wishes to insure objects under their own insurance coverage should submit a copy of their fine arts insurance policy listing any deductibles and exclusions for review by the University of the Pacific Office of Risk Management. This information should be submitted when the formal loan request is made.The certificate of insurance must show the value of each specimen to be insured for loss or damage as follows: adult, juvenile or in utero/newborn cranium or mandible, or both \u2014 $3000; cranium or mandible, or both, of a specimen exhibiting a pathological or anomalous condition (as determined by the CDHCS curator) \u2014 $5000. The borrower will be charged for any damage to specimens (see below) incurred during the loan period, including fragmentation of teeth, breakage of bone, and any other form of alteration of the specimens from their original loaned condition. Damage fees will be assessed between $50 - $200 per specimen per incident, based on the severity of the damage and time required for repair by CDHCS staff.Recall of LoanCDHCS reserves the right to recall the loan for any reason and requires return of the recalled loan within three weeks.Transportation/Packing/StorageThe method of transportation of loaned skulls is by hand carry only. The individual researcher, or a designated courier (CDHCS staff, or a professional courier approved by CDHCS and University of the Pacific), will hand carry the skulls to their destination. Each skull will be packed by CDHCS personnel in a loaned skull box with appropriate packing materials prior to transport. The skull boxes and packing material should be stored in appropriate facilities for preservation. The researcher will repack loans in the same or similar material. If a CDHCS staff member or outside professional is chosen as the courier, all courier expenses, including airline tickets, lodging, courier fee (for supervising unpacking, mounting, installation, de-installation, and repacking), and any other unforeseen expenditures will be paid by the borrower. At the designated destination, the researcher will make arrangements necessary for storage of the loaned skulls in a secured room prior to and after use.Care/PreservationThe individual researcher will protect loans from mishandling, dirt, insects, fire, theft, and extreme variations in light, temperature and humidity at all times. Loans will be handled only by the researcher and experienced professional assistants. Specimen handling will be kept to a minimum. The researcher and assistants will comply with all special handling instructions required by CDHCS in the Specimen Handling Guidelines. The researcher will not clean, repair or alter a loaned specimen (see below). CDHCS reserves the right to inspect the installation and/or use of specimens at any time.SecurityFor exhibit purposes, specimens must be displayed in closed, locked cases. For research or commercial purposes, specimens must be placed in closed, locked cases, so as not to be visible when in storage.Damage/LossRegardless of who is responsible, if a borrowed specimen is damaged or lost while in transit, during unpacking or packing, when being examined, measured, photographed, CT scanned, videotaped, or X-rayed, during installation or de-installation of a display, or while on display, the event must be reported immediately by telephone, fax or email to the CDHCS curator. If pieces of teeth or bone are broken off the specimen, every effort must be made to recover those pieces and return them safely to CDHCS along with the specimen. The researcher may not carry out repairs without the permission of the CDHCS curator. Should any incident occur regarding the borrowed specimen, whether or not damage is apparent, the event must be reported immediately and in writing to CDHCS.Examination/Mounting/Installation RestrictionsNo marker, pencil, pen, paint or other marks of any kind may be made on the specimens during measuring, photographing, scanning, videotaping, mounting or installing. No tape, museum wax, dental wax, glue, nails, screws, staples, wires or other materials may be placed on or into the specimens.Exhibit LabelsIf exhibited, the specimen label should include the following credit line: \"Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy, University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California\" accompanied by the specimen's catalogue number.Exhibit Publicity and ReproductionsWhile on display, specimens may be photographed for use within the exhibition space itself or for Condition reports. Permission for any other use, such as a publication, or printed or electronic promotional materials (i.e., posters, postcards, booklets, photographs, etc.), or items bearing those images (i.e., gift shop mugs, key chains, etc.), must be received in writing from CDHCS. If the researcher receives permission to make photographs for the purpose of an electronic or print publication or publicity, or item of merchandise, CDHCS requests one set of labeled photos and items for its archives. Photography by the general public is not allowed. Subjecting objects to any artificial or natural light beyond that agreed upon for display purposes requires separate permission from the CDHCS.Catalogue/Publication/Research FindingsIf a publication accompanies the exhibition or results from research, CDHCS requests two copies for its archives. CDHCS also requests copies of promotional materials that contain its specimens. If published, the specimen caption should include the following credit line: \"Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy, University of the Pacific, Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California\" accompanied by the specimen's catalogue number. A report of research findings must be provided to CDHCS at the conclusion of a loan made for research purposes regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.Loan ProcessLoan Approval Letter and Loan AgreementFollowing consideration of the initial loan request by the CDHCS curator, and approval by the museum chairperson and administration representative, the borrower and individual researcher they represent will be notified of the approval, in writing, and provided with an invoice for administrative fees and related costs, if any. An itemized list of specimen insurance values will be included within the letter. Once the borrower has complied with loan agreement conditions, and provided a memorandum and certificate of insurance, the loan agreement will be signed by all parties. Once the loan agreement form is signed, no additions to the specimen list are permitted.Loan FormIn addition to possible formal loan agreement documentation, on the day of the loan the researcher will sign an appropriate loan form that will contain, depending on which type of loan, some portion of the following information: specimen catalogue number(s); value of specimen(s); insuring party; researcher's name, phone number, affiliation and email address; brief description of the purpose of loan; proposed means of transport; anticipated date of return; age of each specimen; loaned condition of each specimen (see Loan Condition Report below); brief summaries of specimen care and handling guidelines, and acknowledgement of conditions governing loans. The loan form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Loan Condition ReportWhen the loan is processed, the CDHCS curator will record the skull condition within the faculty teaching/demonstration loan form, including damaged and/or missing areas of the skull and dentition, and congenital conditions. In signing the loan form, the instructor agrees that the borrowed specimens are received in the recorded condition.Loan Period and Renewal of LoanLoans are generally made for a maximum of six months. Requests for renewal must be made in writing to the curator and received 30 days before the expiration of the loan. The loan will be reviewed by the curator, museum committee, and administration representative if more than two renewal requests are submitted.Return of LoanThe researcher agrees to return the loan only to the CDHCS curator, by the date specified in the signed loan agreement, unless other arrangements are agreed to in advance by CDHCS.Loan FeesLoan Handling FeeResearch and exhibit loans are not subject to the administrative loan handling fee. Commercial use loans are subject to the administrative loan handling fee and will be charged a flat rate of $200 per specimen borrowed. This fee covers the cost of locating specimens, producing a loan condition report, processing forms, and packing, receiving and returning specimens to storage. Additional fees apply to commercial use loans that result in product development and distribution, as indicated in the Production of Images section.Loan Request Cancellation FeeOnce a formal loan request has been received from a non-UOP researcher, and review by CDHCS staff has begun, if the loan request is cancelled, withdrawn or postponed indefinitely by the researcher, a loan request cancellation fee of $50 will be charged to the borrower, whether the loan request was made on behalf of a prospective research project, exhibit or for commercial use. In addition, should the commercial use borrower cancel a loan request after a cost, such as the loan handling fee, has been incurred by CDHCS on behalf of the borrower, the borrower is responsible for that cost.InterpretationIn the event of any conflict between this agreement and any forms of the borrower, the terms of this agreement shall be controlling.Research Access to Skull CollectionsResearch RequestsThe Spencer R. Atkinson Library of Applied Anatomy (Atkinson Collection) and P&S Comparative Anatomy collections are open to research by all qualified personnel. Access to the collections is by appointment only. Appointments are scheduled by the CDHCS curator upon receipt of a written statement of research objectives and data collection methods. (See links to research request forms at the top of this page.) All research requests should be emailed toCDHCScurator@pacific.eduon institutional letterhead addressed to:CDHCS CuratorUniversity of the PacificArthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry155 Fifth StreetSan Francisco, CA 94103A report of research findings must be provided to the CDHCS curator at the conclusion of a research study regardless of whether or not a formal publication results.University of the Pacific Faculty and Students, and Visiting ScholarsTo gain research access to the skull collections, please complete the appropriate Research Request application available at this site (see Forms), or request an application form from the CDHCS curator.Research Approval ProcessFor adequate review and scheduling, research requests must be submitted at least three months in advance by visiting scholars and one month in advance by dental school faculty and students. Proposed visit date(s) and study duration will be discussed at the time of research request submission to determine the feasibility of dates and times. Following consideration and approval of the research request by the CDHCS curator, the researcher will be notified of the approval in writing.Research ConditionsResearchersResearch permission is granted only to faculty and students of the University of the Pacific, to visiting scholars affiliated with academic institutions and to medical and dental professionals.Research Use FormOn the day of the visit, the researcher will sign a Research Use Form that contains the following information: Researcher's name, phone number, affiliation or professional address, email address, a brief description of conditions governing research use, and a list of specimens examined. The Research Use Form serves as a means of efficient recordkeeping for CDHCS.Designated Research AreaResearch study of the skull collections by University of the Pacific faculty and students, and by visiting scholars must take place at the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry in the CDHCS's designated research area. Special permission must be obtained to transport specimens to nearby facilities, inside or outside the dental school, for photographing, X-raying or CT scanning.Specimen SelectionTo facilitate the sample selection process, an on-site Atkinson database is now available for use by researchers. Pre-selection of skulls using images and information in the database will minimize the visitor's need to survey the collection itself, an activity CDHCS discourages due to collection preservation concerns. If preferable, based on the objectives of the study and in consultation with the researcher, the CDHCS curator will select a specific or random sample of specimens from the skull collection.Care and PreservationThe curator will do most of the handling of the specimens, retrieving them from the storage cabinets for study and returning them after examination is completed. In this manner the potential for damage to the specimens is minimized. On the first day of the study, the researcher will be asked to read CDHCS's Procedural Advice for Handling Skulls guidelines and to sign a research form. There are no restrictions on the number of specimens available for study.Research FeesCurrently there are no research fees charged to students and faculty, or to visiting scholars.Teaching Access to Skull CollectionsTeaching Requests\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Off-Site or On-Site LocationThe P&S Comparative Anatomy Collection and a subset of specimens from the Atkinson Collection are available to University of the Pacific faculty for teaching and class demonstrations located either off-site within the dental school building or on-site in room 410, the CDHCS facility.

If it is after hours please call the same number (209.946.2315, extension 2) and leave a message. We will return your phone call within twobusinesshours.What kind of training does your staff have? Do you have students working at the counseling center?All members of our permanent staff (psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, and psychiatrist) have finished their degree programs. We also have two master's level clinicians on staff each year who are doctoral psychology interns. These clinicians come to us with considerable counseling experience, having finished all academic requirements for their doctoral programs from across the country. No undergraduate students work at CAPS.Do you have therapists who can work with people from varying backgrounds and cultures?Yes. Our therapists are trained to work with students from many cultures and backgrounds. We respect racial and cultural diversity.Do you have therapists who are familiar with sexual identity (including questioning) and gender identity concerns?Yes. Our therapists are trained to work with gay, lesbian, bisexual, gender variant, and questioning clients. Our therapists respect sexual and gender diversity and affirm gay, lesbian, bisexual, gender variant, and questioning individuals.How many students go to CAPS?Most years, we see about one in eight undergraduate and graduate students.What kinds of problems can I be seen for at CAPS?We help students with a variety of problems, ranging from homesickness to severe mental illness. For example, we see students with symptoms of anxiety and / or depression, we see couples with relationship difficulties, we see individuals with mental illnesses such as Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, and we see students who are adjusting to living away from home for the first time. These are all typical of the types of issues or concerns that we handle on a daily basis.Is there a limit to how long I can receive therapy at CAPS?Yes. Since we try to serve as many students as possible, in most cases we limit the number of sessions you can be seen each year. The therapy we offer is intended to be short-term (i.e., up to 5 sessions a semester) in most cases. If you think you want or need longer term therapy, you will need to discuss your therapy needs with your therapist.Is everything confidential? Can my parents or professors find out I've been to CAPS?The records at Counseling and Psychological Services are totally separate from the rest of your records at Pacific. For the most part, the fact that you have come to CAPS and what you discussed here is confidential and will not be revealed to anyone outside of CAPS. However, there are rare exceptions. For example, if you tell us that a child or someone over the age of 65 is being abused, we have to report that to the appropriate agency. If you tell us that you plan to seriously hurt yourself or someone else, we may have to intervene to ensure everyone's safety. We also sometimes work in conjunction with medical staff at Pacific Health Services and / or with the Student Victim Advocate. These exceptions are detailed in the Informed Consent statement you will be given during your first appointment. Additionally, the therapist you see will answer any further questions you have about exceptions to confidentiality.Is it true that you won't see some students? My friend said you wouldn't give him counseling and told him to see a private therapist.We will meet with any student for an initial assessment. There are circumstances in which the therapist determines that an individual's needs are beyond the scope of the services offered at CAPS. In these instances, we will offer a referral to other sources of help on or off campus.What if I need medication?CAPS has a part-time psychiatrist that is available 9 hours a week (Monday and Wednesday mornings, Tuesday afternoons) and works with students across our three campuses. Appointments to meet with our psychiatrist fill quickly, so we recommend scheduling an appointment as soon as possible in order to get your medication needs met.Appointments can be scheduled by calling 209.946.2315 x2 or completing ourappointment request formonline.I think I might have a problem with drinking or substance use. Can you help with that?Yes. We have therapists on staff who help students who have alcohol or drug related concerns. Often students also benefit from meeting with a CAPS therapist to discuss personal concerns that may relate to the substance use.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

You may utilize the emergency phones located throughout the campus for reporting emergencies. Finally, campus elevators are equipped with emergency phones that also connect to Public Safety.Stockton Campus - 209.946.3911Sacramento Campus - 916.739.7200San Francisco Campus - 415.929.6411Members of the University community are strongly encouraged to report all crimes and suspicious activity to their campus Department of Public Safety/Security or appropriate police agency in a prompt and timely manner.Why report an alleged incident?Alleged acts of bias, hate, discrimination, harassment and discriminatory harassment should be reported so the University can determine if any laws or policies have been violated and to support individuals who may have been victimized. Also, filing a report helps the University create a safe and welcoming campus climate that better supports everyone's ability to learn and/or work. If bias-related incidents go unreported, it makes it difficult for the University to appropriately address the issue, it diminishes campus climate, it may make some members of our community feel unsafe or unwelcome, or additional incidents may occur.What happens after a report has been filed?Because Pacific remains deeply committed to promoting and maintaining a civil community and maintaining a community that is respectful of all persons, the University will address all reported incidents that violate the student code of conduct, University policies and/or federal, state and local laws.An individual filing a report should know that once the University has received a report, the following steps typically occur:Confirmation that the report has been received will be communicated within 2 business days (should the individual(s) filing the report choose to include his/her name and contact information).Careful review of the details of the report to ensure that we have accurately understood the nature of the occurrence or violation.Conduct outreach to gather any additional relevant information that may be required in order determine what, if any, conduct, policy or legal violation has occurred:The process may include contacting individuals or groups who may have been involved in the occurrence as a bystander, a reporter or a respondent in order to obtain more information and/or it may include communicating with other appropriate campus officials, departments/offices or organizations.The University reserves the right to review incidents which may have occurred on and off campus when it involves a member of the Pacific community and depending upon the seriousness of the alleged conduct, policy or legal violation.Provide a safe setting for anyone involved in the incident to share information about what has occurred and as needed, make referrals to appropriate campus and community resources including the University's Victim's Advocate Program and the Counseling Center among others:Individuals will have an opportunity to learn what services are available to assist them as well as how to access and utilize those services.Determine an appropriate response to an occurrence, which may require assistance from appropriate campus offices or departments.In the case of students, the office of student conduct may be referred to.Matters involving University employees may be referred to Human Resources.Initiate appropriate outreach and education since the unfortunate occurrence of an incident may create specific educational opportunities for those connected to the incident through additional interventions:It provides the University with an opportunity to restate our commitment to Pacific's principles \"that diversity and inclusion are essential to the fulfillment of our institutional mission. We value inclusiveness in learning, curricular and co-curricular programming, campus climate, recruitment, admissions, hiring and retention.\"Depending upon the nature of the incident and the type of response that is required, key campus officials may initiate meetings with appropriate individuals or affinity groups to offer ongoing support, advocacy and/or updated information.Educating everyone, students, faculty, staff, alumni and our local community, about bias-related matters is important. Further, without breaching anyone's confidentiality or right to privacy, this may be an opportunity to develop curricular and co-curricular experiences that can be offered throughout the academic year that foster the advancement of diversity and inclusion.The Bias Response process is managed through the Senior Director of Culture and Belonging,\u00a0Rolly Kali-Rai,\u00a0who\u00a0may be contacted atrkalirai@pacific.edu.Will the campus community be notified of the outcome?It should be noted that to the extent that federal, state and local law as well as University policies permit, Pacific will keep appropriate individuals and groups apprised of the progress of an investigation and the final outcome on a \"need-to-know\" basis.To protect the privacy of all the individuals or groups involved, the University may not be able to release some of the details related to the incident; however, a summary report of all bias reporting, outcomes and findings will be used to proactively guide education and prevention efforts to foster culture and belonging.To remain compliant with the Clery Act, reported hate crimes will become a part of the mandatory documentation that is posted regularly with the Office of Public Safety's crime statistics.Stockton Campus3601 Pacific Ave.Stockton, CA 95211Admissions: 209.946.2211Sacramento Campus3200 Fifth Ave.Sacramento, California 95817Admissions: 916.739.7105San Francisco Campus155 Fifth St.San Francisco, California 94103Admissions: 415.929.6491FooterCOVID-19 ResponseJobsMyPacificEmergency InfoUniversity PoliciesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementTitle IX ResourcesNon-Discrimination StatementAnnual Security ReportEvent ServicesContact Us\u00a9 2023 University of the\n        PacificClose Search",

This program allows institutions of higher learning (degree granting institutions) in the United States to voluntarily enter into an agreement with VA to fund tuition expenses that exceed the highest public in-state undergraduate tuition rate. The institution can contribute up to 50% of those expenses and the VA will match the same amount at the institution.Who is eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program?Only veterans entitled to the maximum benefit rate of 100 percent, as determined by the service requirements, or their designated transferees may receive Yellow Ribbon benefits from Pacific and the VA. Active-duty service members and their spouses are not eligible for this program.The general eligibility requirements for the Yellow Ribbon Program include:You served an aggregate period of 36 months in active duty after Sept. 10, 2001.You were honorably discharged from active duty for a service-connected disability and you served 30 continuous days after Sept. 10, 2001.You are a dependent eligible for Transfer of Entitlement under the Post-9/11 GI Bill\u00aebased on the service eligibility criteria listed above.We encourage all veterans to review the eligibility criteria directly from theYellow Ribbon Program page on the VA\u2019s website.What are McGeorge\u2019s Yellow Ribbon benefits?Only McGeorge students are eligible to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program at McGeorge.This award will be offered to a maximum of 60 eligible McGeorge veteransThey will receive up to 100% of the unmet established charges (tuition & student fees) per academic yearThe actual amount will vary based on number of units taken and charged for each semester.

Here you will find information about:Cost and Financial AidThe public administration and public policy programs and the McGeorge School of LawCurriculum and RequirementsStudent LifeIf you have a question that isn't answered here,please contact us.Cost and Financial AidAre scholarships available?Each application to the MPA and MPP programs is automatically considered for scholarships. If accepted, the letter of admission will include details about the scholarship assistance McGeorge is able to offer. Most students receive a scholarship. Scholarship amounts are dependent on the strength of the application, the timing of the recruitment cycle, and other factors. For this reason, it is strongly encouraged that prospective applicants submit their application as early as possible to maximize the benefits which are available to them. Additionally, the McGeorge Financial Aid office is available to advise on Federal assistance programs, and other options available to graduate students.How much do the programs cost?Each semester, students pay tuition based on the number of units they are taking. Tuition for the 2023-24 academic year is $1,500 per unit, and students enroll in 4-12 units per semester. Fees for the Wellness Center and student activities range from $140 to $215 per semester. Finally, all students are required to have health insurance. If a student is not already covered under a health insurance plan, they will be required to purchase the student health insurance plan. Total tuition for the 36-unit MPA degree is $54,000 and for the 44-unit MPP degree is $66,000 before accounting for scholarships and other financial aid. Scholarships range from 10% to 50% of tuition.What financial aid is available?All students are considered for partial tuition scholarships when they apply. In addition, federal student loans and on-campus work-study jobs are available for qualified students who complete the FAFSA.Can federal loans be forgiven by public service?Some federal loans can be partially forgiven if employed in public service.Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF)Does McGeorge participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program for veterans?McGeorge is proud to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program.Information about Eligibility & BenefitsThe MPA/MPP Programs and the McGeorge School of LawDoes the American Bar Association accredit the MPP or MPA degrees?No, the ABA only accredits the JD degree at any law school, including McGeorge. The American Bar Association approved offering this degree through McGeorge School of Law by granting \"acquiescence\" In 2015. This allowed the MPA and MPP programs to be offered under the law school as well as allowing JD students to take public policy courses as electives.How does this program fit into law degrees at McGeorge?McGeorge School of Law offers the JD, MSL, LLM, and JSD law-related degrees and two non-law degrees \u2014 the MPP and MPA. The public policy and law degrees complement and strengthen each other. You will take at least two law courses among your required courses and more for an area of concentration. Law students may enroll in public policy courses and some students will pursue both a JD and MPP or JD and MPA degree.Is it possible to earn a JD degree as well as a MPP or a MPA?Through McGeorge\u2019s dual-degree program, you can earn both the JD and the MPP or MPA with just one more year of study in addition to that required for the JD, but saving a year compared to pursuing both degrees independently. Admission to the JD program requires a separate application, and admission into the MPA or MPP program does not guarantee admission into the dual-degree program for the JD.McGeorge\u2019s dual-degree programWhat is McGeorge\u2019s Influence in the Community?McGeorge School of Law has been educating lawyers in Sacramento since the 1920s. McGeorge alumni dominate lists of the 100 most influential attorneys in Sacramento and McGeorge alumni are leaders in state agencies, lobbying firms and non-profit organizations as well as law firms in Sacramento and beyond.Members of our McGeorge family serve on nonprofit boards, provide pro-bono legal services, and participate as active community volunteers for dozens of local and national community outreach organizations. Students, faculty, staff and alumni contribute thousands of hours annually to support important community and charitable efforts.Curriculum and RequirementsWhat are classes like?Our courses are typically comprised of 10-25 students. Classes are structured to allow for a working schedule, with most courses being offered in-person during the evenings or on weekends. While a few courses and individual class sessions are on-line, the vast majority of classes are taught in-person on our Sacramento campus.In PUB classes, students engage in spirited policy discussions and learn about innovative management approaches from experienced professionals. Most assignments take the form of recognized professional work products, such as a decision memo, an analysis to be presented to a committee of the California state legislature, an issue brief or comment on a proposed regulation. Some assignments are individual, while others are based on team work.Is a thesis required?No. Our Masters of Public Administration and Masters of Public Policy programs focus on practical professional skills. Instead of writing a thesis (a type of document you are unlikely to replicate later in your career) you'll participate in a capstone course. This capstone course requires students to construct a professional presentation on a major issue of public administration and/or policy by pulling together the knowledge and skills gained from all previous classes.How Should I choose between the MPA and the MPP?Are you most interested in working with others to implement public policies? Do you like partnering with or managing others in direct actions? If so, the MPA, which emphasizes leading and managing competencies, is a good choice. Are you most interested in analyzing how to solve complex public policy issues, including how to identify and assess options for action? Do you like developing policy proposals and then getting them enacted into law or regulation? If so, the MPP which emphasizes analytic and policy making competencies, is a good choice. We would be happy to work with you in figuring out which program is a better fit for your strengths and needs.Student LifeWhy Sacramento?No state and few nations face the complexity and consequence of policy choices made and implemented in California. The campus, located just 10 minutes from the State Capitol, is at the epicenter of the offices of state, federal and local agencies, plus those of non-profits and advocacy firms focused on public policy making and implementation. This proximity ensures that our students are able to analyze, observe and engage in today's most critical issues.Sacramento is also an excellent place to live, work, and play! CareerBliss rated Sacramento 1st for Happiest Workers in Mid-Sized Cities. Bloomberg Businessweek placed Sacramento 2nd in their Top 10 Most Fun, Affordable U.S. Cities. Sometimes referred to as the City of Trees, Sacramento has the most canopy coverage of any major city in the United States, and comes in 3rd worldwide (MIT, Treepedia).Sacramento \u2014 The Capital City on the MoveIs on-campus housing available?University of Pacific\u2019s Sacramento campus offers a variety of on-campus housing opportunities.

Summer classes may be required to complete the part-time program in four years. Students may also be able to accelerate the part-time program to three and one-half years by increasing their course load after the first year of study.Is it easier to be admitted to the Part-time Division than the Full-time Division?The admissions standards for the full-time and part-time programs are the same. In some cases, the undergraduate record is given different weight in relation to more recent employment or graduate work experiences since undergraduate work may have been completed many years ago. In addition, the admissions committee may offer full-time program applicants a seat in the part-time program if it is determined that the student may have better success in that program.Does McGeorge have an early decision or early admission deadline?No. However, we do have a priority deadline of Feb. 1. Applications received and completed by Feb. 1 will receive a decision by the first week of March.How long are LSAT scores valid?LSAT scores are valid for five years from the date of administration.

In support of the application, applicants must submit two letters of recommendation directly to LSAC. We will accept a maximum of three letters. Applicants are encouraged to reach out to college professors and administrators who have had the opportunity to assess their academic aptitude to write letters on their behalf. Applicants who have been out of school for a considerable amount of time (five or more years) may submit letters of recommendation from employers, business colleagues, and mentors who can speak to the skills necessary to be a successful law student including, but not limited to, superior writing skills and critical thinking and analysis.What was the median LSAT and GPA for 2023's entering JD class?LSATGPA75th Percentile1583.65Median1553.4425th Percentile1523.07If I apply now and take the LSAT on a future date, when can I expect to receive a decision?Applying with a future LSAT will delay a decision.

Decisions may be rendered anywhere between 6 to 12 weeks from the date an application is complete.Visit ourEntering Class Profileto learn more about our 2023 entering JD class.How does McGeorge evaluate multiple LSAT scores?All scores are reported by LSAC. McGeorge will consider all scores in the admissions review process. However, the high score is used for merit scholarships and ABA required reporting. We recommend you prepare for the LSAT and plan on taking it just once. If you are not satisfied with your score and think you can improve, you may want to consider retaking the LSAT. If you have multiple LSAT scores, with a five-point difference or greater, an LSAT disparity addendum is required with your application.Can I schedule an admissions interview at McGeorge?McGeorge does not offer interviews as part of the admissions process. However, we do offer prospective students and wait-listed students the opportunity to speak with an admissions counselor.

For more information on scholarships please visit ourfinancial aidandscholarshipweb pages.Although I have a strong G.P.A. for the last 60 units of my undergrad, I did poorly during my freshman year. Does this mean I won't get admitted?Grade trends such as this are evaluated often. Many students have uneven year-by-year undergraduate records. Evidence of overall academic strength is more important and, in general, superior performance in recent rigorous academic work is of significance, even if earlier grades were at a lower performance level. A short explanatory addendum to your personal statement is a good place to address such deficiencies.What factors does McGeorge consider when evaluating applications, and how are those factors weighed in the review process?The two largest components that are considered in predicting an applicant's relative success in law school are the grade point average and the LSAT score. Though these are useful predictors, they are not the only factors the admissions committee will consider when reviewing your application. McGeorge reviews each application in its entirety, considering every component. The admissions committee will take into consideration grade trends, leadership, volunteer and work experience, the personal statement, any addenda the applicant submits, and any information included in letters of recommendation. All components assist the admissions committee in determining an applicant\u2019s academic potential and propensity for success in law school.How much is JD tuition?Tuition (subject to Board of Regents approval) for the 2023-2024 academic year is $59,080 for the full-time program and $39,283 for the part-time program.We expect a 3% increase in tuition for the 2024-2025 academic year.\u00a0Please note that there are additional required fees and summer school is charged on a per unit basis;visit our tuition pagefor more information.How do I find out more about financial aid?For complete information on deadlines, options and the financial aid process, please visit thefinancial aid web page.

Dugoni School of Dentistry?A: No, all IDS applicants (first-time or returning) must submit a CAAPID application directly with the American Dental Education Association (ADEA).Q: I have previously submitted an application directly to the Dugoni School of Dentistry. Do I need to submit a CAAPID application?A: Yes, all returning applicants must submit a CAAPID application with American Dental Education Association (ADEA).Q: I applied last year and had to submit a PDF file of supplemental documents. Are these materials still required?A: No, all materials including transcripts, letters of recommendation, and test scores should all be sent through your CAAPID application. IDS Admissions will no longer accept duplicate or supplemental documents manually.Q: What happens when I submit my CAAPID application with ADEA on the deadline date?A: Applicants are highly encouraged not to wait until the deadline to submit their CAAPID application. Applicants who do apply on or near theADEA/CAAPID deadline\u2014Friday, June 9, 2023, 11:59 pm Eastern Time, must take full responsibility to fulfill ADEA's application requirements by filing an online CAAPID application, paying the processing fee, and providing all test scores, letters, and other documentation required prior to the deadline. It is also important to understand that ADEA may take more than 2 weeks before releasing the CAAPID application to Pacific, so the earlier you can submit your application, the better.Q: I see that I can still submit my CAAPID application to other programs, but I am not able to submit it to the Dugoni School. Is this normal after the application deadline?A: Yes, many programs using the CAAPID application service all have their own deadlines and processes. The Dugoni School of Dentistry has set their deadline for Friday, June 9, 2023, by 11:59 pm Eastern Time, though your CAAPID application will remain active until early February 2024. During this time, you may also submit your CAAPID applications to other programs. Our deadline is final, and no exceptions or extensions will be made. We always encourage applicants to be familiar with all dates and deadlines associated with other schools that they are planning to apply to.Important Note:The new ADEA Program Finder toolis now live (as of January 2023) for ADEA CAAPID programs! Check out this page for more information on programs you are looking into applying for this cycle.Q: I paid my supplemental application fee of $100 but was not able to submit my CAAPID application in time. Can I still be considered for admission?A: No. We are not able to review materials submitted without a valid and complete CAAPID application submitted by the deadline in June.Application FeeQ: Can I pay the application fee online with a credit card?A: Applicants will pay the $100 (USD \u2014 non-refundable) application fee online with a credit card (American Express, Discover, Mastercard or Visa). Please be sure to provide all requested payment information, including your CAAPID #.Q: Is the supplemental application fee different from the fees I already paid through CAAPID?A: Yes. You are required to pay all ADEA CAAPID fees associated with your application to each dental school. The Dugoni School\u2019s separate application fee of $100 can be paid through\u00a0the school's online payment portal.Q: I\u2019ve paid my $100 supplemental application fee but wasn\u2019t able to submit my CAAPID application. Is the application fee refundable?A: No, unfortunately there are no refunds given for the $100 fee. We recommend candidates wait until submitting their completed CAAPID application successfullybeforepaying the Dugoni School\u2019s $100 fee.Q: Do you accept fee waivers from the ADEA Fee Assistance Program?A: No, fee waivers only pertain to fees associated with ADEA. Our application fee is required for processing applications.Dental Curriculum Vitae (CV)Q: Do I need to copy the same format of the provided sample dental CV?A: We strongly recommend using the sample CV as a guide to ensure the admissions committee thoroughly reviews your experiences and accomplishments. Applicants should provide information about their dental experience from the time of earning their initial dental degree to present (unless noted otherwise). It is recommended that you replicate the sample CV and classify your dental experience by International and/or United States / Canada.Q: Can I submit updates to my dental CV after my CAAPID application is submitted?A: No, the IDS Admissions office will not be accepting any application updates after the CAAPID application is submitted. Make sure to submit your application with as much information on your file as possible, to ensure the admissions committee has all the information needed to make an informed decision regarding your application.Q: What if I do not have anything to include under one of the categorical heading options (i.e., I never received an advanced degree)?A: If you do not have any information to provide under a specific category, you can leave out that section header.Q: When I am logging my research experience, do I also log any associated publications I have completed with the research section, or do I also log publications in the section for publications (presentations, etc.).A: If you published any writing during your research experience, you would log your total research hours for each project in the research section AND log the publication you were a part of under the publications section.Q: How would I list conferences that I have attended on my dental CV?A: If you arepresentingat a conference, list the presentation itself under \u201cpresentations.\u201d If youattendedthe conference, this would likely go under Continuing Education, if CE credits were earned at this conference. If no CE credits were earned by attending the conference, do not include it on your CV.Q: Should I include any experiences, dental or non-dental related, from the time prior to receiving my initial dental degree?A: No, the committee will only score and consider experiences that are gained AFTER the receipt of your initial dental degree.Note:any internships, preceptorships, etc. that are part of your dental degree graduation requirements should not be included on the dental CV, as they are part of your degree requirements.Q: When I am listing my Continuing Dental Education (CDE) credits, do I list a summary of the hours, or should I list every course that I have taken?A: We prefer and recommend that applicants list ALL CDE related courses, both online and in-person on their dental CVs. Please make sure to still sort them by International CDE courses and US/Canada CDE courses, as with all section categories on your CV.Q: I have applied in a previous application year, and in the past I had to include all my other documents and files with my dental CV and send it as a PDF directly to admissions. Is this still required?A: No, we no longer ask for or accept additional files outside of the CAAPID application. There is a section on the CAAPID application, where you can upload additional files, including your Dental CV.Applications will not be considered complete without uploading your Dental CV.Letters of EvaluationQ: What if I have dental experience I\u2019d like to include in my application that was completed before my dental degree? Can I put it on my CV?A: The CV is geared towards getting information on experiences after dental school only (some sections allow items from during dental school). However, you will also be logging experiences directly on your CAAPID application. In the CAAPID experiences section, you may include any experiences gained prior to your dental degree in this area.Q: How many letters of recommendation are required for admission?A: Three letters are required, submitted through your ADEA CAAPID Application. Otherwise known as \u201cEvaluations,\u201d all three letters should be written in English (or translated to English by a certified translator) and should be as recent as possible written, signed, and dated no later than January 2020.Q: Who should I ask to write these letters for me?At least two of these three letters must be written by either U.S. or international dental professionals (dentists, dental school faculty, etc.) with whom you have worked or studied from. A letter from a dental school dean is not required.Q: What instructions should I give my evaluators to ensure that the letters are submitted properly?A: Please have your evaluators follow the following guidelines when submitting their letters:Provide the letter on company or school letterhead.Evaluators need to include theirname, phone number, email,andmailing addresseither directly on the letter or through the CAAPID submission process.Letters must be hand signed by the evaluator. Digitally signed letters will not be accepted.Q: When do the letters need to be submitted by?A: No later than the UOP Application Deadline in June. For the 2023-24 Application Cycle, the deadline to submit letters through ADEA CAAPID is Friday, June 9th, 2023, by 11:59 PM Eastern Time.Q: What if my evaluator sent in their letter to CAAPID without a physical signature or letterhead?A: If we find that a letter is missing a requirement such as a signature or letterhead while processing applications prior to the June application deadline, IDS Admissions will email the applicant with specific instructions and deadlines to have the evaluator correct the error, and to re-send the letter to us directly atids@pacific.edu. Only letters of correction requested by the Office of Admissions will be accepted outside the ADEA CAAPID application. Failure to correct errors in a timely manner can cause your file to be incomplete after the June deadline passes.Q: Do I need to submit letters of evaluation to the Dugoni School of Dentistry when I already submitted them to ADEA CAAPID?A: No, ADEA CAAPID will ask for up to three letters when you are completing your application. Please submit your evaluations that we require through ADEA CAAPID as instructed on your application.Q: To whom should the letters of evaluation be addressed?A: The letters of evaluation should be addressed to the IDS Admissions Committee.Q: May I submit more than 3 letters of evaluation to Pacific?A: No. We will not accept additional letters of recommendation past the three required by ADEA CAAPID. Additional letters sent to us directly will not be considered for your application.Q: What happens if my letter is not written in English?A: Applicants will be required to provide the letter in its original language along with an English translation from a certified translator.National Board Dental Examination (NBDE1&2 or INBDE)Q: Can I apply to the IDS program now and take the NBDE 1&2 or INBDE later?A: No, applicants must take and pass NBDE 1&2 or INBDE by application deadline and request ADA Department of Testing Services to submit results to ADEA.Q: Will my application be considered with a NBDE score of 74 (just one point from 75) or a Fail result to NBDE or INBDE?A: No, applicants who earned a score less than 75 or a Fail result, are encouraged to retake the NBDE 1&2 or INBDE to earn a Pass result; otherwise, the application will be considered incomplete and will not be reviewed by the IDS Admissions Committee.Q: Does the Admissions Committee consider the number of attempts when reviewing these submissions?A: The IDS Admissions Committee evaluates applications holistically, so the number of attempts would not disqualify an applicant from applying to our program.Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)Q: Am I required to take the TOEFL?A: Yes, all applicants, including U.S. citizens, are required to take the TOEFL. Request ETS to provide the TOEFL score report to ADEA (institution code \u2013 B451) with scores earned between January 2021 to present. An internet-based test (iBT) total score of 92 or higher is required.Q: Am I exempt from taking the TOEFL when I have earned a degree from a U.S. college/university that did not require me to take a TOEFL since my English is good/proficient?A: There are no exemptions. All applicants are required to take the TOEFL.Q: Can I apply to the IDS program now and take the TOEFL later?A: No, it is recommended to wait for the TOEFL result\u00a0before sending the PDF email attachment with all the supplemental documents.Q: Will my application be considered with a TOEFL internet-based test (iBT) total score of 91?A: No, applicants who earned less than the iBT total score of 92 are encouraged to retake the TOEFL; otherwise, the application will be considered incomplete and will not be reviewed by the IDS Admissions Committee.Q: Do you accept MyBest scores?A: No, MyBest scores will not be considered. IDS Admissions will only accept TOEFL scores from a single test date.Q: I have taken the TOEFL exam more than once. How does the IDS Admissions Committee consider multiple TOEFL scores?A: We do not have a limit on the number of TOEFL attempts taken. However, the Admissions Committee will only considerthe most recent score. I.e., if you get a lower score when you retake the TOEFL, the Admissions Committee will consider that new score, and the higher first score will be voided.Q: Will you accept TOEFL retakes that are taken after application submission?A: Yes if we receive the TOEFL scores before the June deadline. We will include the new scores for the committee\u2019s review. After the deadline, we will not consider the new TOEFL scores.Dental Diploma/CertificateQ: Can I apply with a medical degree?A: Only applicants who have earned a dental degree (BDS, DDS, DMD, Odontology, Stomatology) are eligible to apply to the IDS program.Q: Can I apply with a provisional dental degree?A: IDS Admissions do not accept provisional dental degrees nor offer any exceptions to this dental degree requirement. Applicants are required to submit a scanned version of the dental diploma/certificate to be included in the uploaded documents section of their CAAPID application.Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE)Q: What grade average will be considered?A: A U.S. grade average of 2.00 \u2013 4.00 is required. Applicants with a grade average of 0 \u2013 1.99 will not be eligible to apply to the IDS program.Q: Do you accept any other agency\u2019s evaluations?A: IDS Admissions will only accept ECE course-by-course evaluation with a U.S. grade average of 2.00 \u2013 4.00.Q: What if I discover an error was made on my grade average calculation?A: Corrected grade average from the ECE course-by-course evaluations will be considered as long as they are received by us before the June deadline. If ECE provides an additional grade average score (i.e., best result or comprehensive), Pacific will only consider thecomprehensive grade average.Financial Aid/ScholarshipsQ: As an international student, am I eligible to apply for federal financial aid?A: This depends on your current citizenship/visa status. Only students who are U.S. citizens, U.S. permanent residents or eligible non-citizens are eligible to apply for federal financial aid.Q: Does the Dugoni School of Dentistry provide any kind of scholarships for the applicants?A: The Dugoni School of Dentistry has limited institutional scholarships; however, there is no guarantee of receipt of these funds.
